    "# 💻-coders 2024-10-28\n\n## Summary\n During the discussion, participants focused on integrating various technologies into their projects. Big Dookie shared his experience with rewriting functions from Swift to React Native for an Android app that allows users to record beatbox or fart noises, which are then processed by a model. He mentioned using App.tsx and custom components for waveform creation in the application. The team also discussed leveraging Discord at scale and integrating with OpenAI's Eliza source code, as well as running local models after Shaw pushed a new commit. Additionally, they explored the possibility of agents reading social media feeds without relying on an API.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the Android app mentioned in the conversation?\n  - Big dookie: The Android app allows users to record beatbox or fart noises which are then processed by a model that continues the user's input, displaying two waveforms on screen simultaneously. This functionality required custom development for react-native due to its limitations compared to Swift.\n\n- How did they handle waveform creation and playback in React Native?\n  - Big dookie: They created custom components specifically for waveform generation and a playback manager, as the default implementation of react-native was not sufficient for their needs. This involved getting amplitudes and other necessary data from scratch to ensure proper functionality within the app.\n\n- What is Eliza source code integration with OpenAI?\n  - 0xFanz: The user intended to discuss integrating a pre-existing project called \"Eliza\" (likely an AI chatbot) with OpenAI's technology, but it seems there was some confusion about the specific details or context of this integration.\n\n- How can agents read social media feeds without relying on APIs?\n  - SotoAlt | WAWE: The user asked if it is possible for their AI agents to access and process data from social media platforms directly, bypassing the need for official API integrations. This question was raised as a general concern or idea but did not receive a direct answer in the provided conversation snippet.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - big dookie helped whobody with understanding the Android app by explaining its functionality, including recording a beatbox or fart noises and managing waveforms.\n- ferric | stakeware.xyz attempted to assist 0xFanz with editing startAgent but did not provide clear help as they were unsure what it was.\n- SotoAlt | WAWE helped the team by suggesting an idea for agents to read a social media feed without relying on an API, potentially solving a problem related to data sourcing for the agents.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Integrate Eliza source code with OpenAI models (mentioned by 0xFanz)\n  - Edit startAgent function in the context of integrating Eliza and OpenAI (implied need by 0xFanz)\n  - Improve Android app beatbox recording functionality, specifically transitioning from Swift to React Native (big dookie)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - No explicit documentation needs were mentioned.\n- Feature Requests\n  - Designed space for the arena in the application (whobody)\n  - Chrome extensions integration with Eliza and OpenAI models (whobody)\n- Community Tasks\n  - Leveraging Discord at scale within the project (mentioned by whobody, no explicit leader mentioned)\n\n",

They are set to collaborate immediately on this initiative. Meanwhile, SotoAlt | WAWE reported issues with the agent using an outdated personality for Twitter and Discord interactions despite deleting the old one; they planned to clone the repo and start from scratch once back at their desk. Additionally, SotoAlt mentioned troubleshooting problems with OpenAI API request formatting by copying the exact format from OpenAI's documentation after encountering a 400 error bad request.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the cause of the warning \"Registering ts-node/esm\" when running a Node.js application?\n  - Chad: This warning typically occurs due to an outdated version of ts-node or its dependencies, which might not be compatible with your current setup. To resolve this issue, you can try updating ts-node and related packages using `npm update` or explicitly installing the latest versions. Additionally, running `node --trace-warnings ...` will help identify where exactly in your codebase the warning is being triggered, allowing for more targeted troubleshooting.\n\n- How to resolve issues with an agent generating text from an old personality when using a new one?\n  - Shaw: This issue might be related to caching or improperly loaded dependencies like llama.cpp and onnxruntime. To address this problem, you can try running `npm run build` to check for any errors during the build process that could indicate issues with these dependencies. Additionally, cloning the repository from scratch may help ensure a clean environment without residual files or configurations causing conflicts between old and new personalities.\n\n- What steps should be taken when encountering a 400 error (Bad Request) while using an API?\n  - SotoAlt | WAWE: A 400 Bad Request error typically indicates that the server cannot process your request due to invalid syntax or missing parameters. In this case, it seems like there might be issues with the API request formatting in the repository you're using.

    "# 💻-coders 2024-11-06\n\n## Summary\n In the chat, Ophiuchus shared updates on integrating an Ollama model into their system, detailing code changes for managing different providers within a staking platform. They highlighted using `aiGenerateText` from node-based AI libraries and leveraged Ollama's embedding capabilities to avoid local C++ or OpenAI dependencies. Ferric acknowledged the significant increase in coin value due to these updates, while SotoAlt congratulated on the achievement. Additionally, BigSky inquired about Eliza's functionality within Telegram groups, and Ophiuchus confirmed its mixed performance with recent versions but committed to resolving issues promptly. A crucial technical adjustment was made by adding specific configurations to `packages/agent/tsconfig.json` for the latest build compatibility.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the purpose of using Ollama model in this code?\n  - Ophiuchus: The Ollama model is used here as a text generation AI provider within their system. It's initialized with its endpoint, and then utilized to generate responses based on given prompts, temperature settings, max tokens, frequency penalty, and presence penalty parameters. This allows the application to produce human-like textual content dynamically.\n\n- How does Ollama model differ from other AI models like local-cpp or OpenAI?\n  - Ophiuchus: The primary difference lies in how embeddings are handled. With Ollama, embedding calls are supported directly by the provider instead of relying on a locally compiled C++ library (local-cpp) or an external API service like OpenAI. This integration simplifies the process and potentially improves performance since it doesn't require additional dependencies for handling embeddings.\n\n- What issue did Ophiuchus face with Eliza in Telegram groups, and how was it resolved?\n  - Ophiuchus: Initially, an older version of their system could respond well to prompts within a Telegram group. However, the latest version required direct prompting to generate responses. To address this issue, they merged a pull request (PR) that included changes in the packages/agent/tsconfig.json file. Specifically, they added \"moduleResolution\": \"Bundler\" and updated other compiler options for better compatibility with their system's architecture. This resolved the problem, allowing Eliza to respond more effectively within Telegram groups without needing direct prompts.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Ophiuchus helped with code changes for ollama provider by uploading the updated code to demonstrate how it's done.

    "# 💻-coders 2024-11-19\n\n## Summary\n In the chat, participants discuss various technical issues related to setting up an AI character model using a GitHub repository. Kanye encounters errors when trying to start the project with edited index.js files, while YoungPhlo inquires if others experienced SQLite3 errors during setup and whether they used the main branch or not. Big dookie shares their experience of hitting a \"prefix match hit\" limit, suggesting that it might be related to token usage in reading character files. Odilitime expresses enthusiasm for hot reloading and makes an official request on GitHub for its implementation. Seb asks if there's a way to train the AI with specific personalities by feeding scripts from movies or other sources, while brownie suggests using Grok or ChatGPT for character conversion without needing additional input. 18 Rabbit reports issues when running pnpm start with different characters and mentions that they tried building locally before encountering errors. Odilitime advises on potential timeouts due to model processing time and encourages retrying the process, while also mentioning local llama usage and GitHub address attempts for accessing content.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the error message when trying to run index.js with a character file?\n  - Kanye: The error message indicates that there's an issue with the agent not being found or invalid JSON, possibly due to hitting prompt limits while reading the character file.\n- How can one train the AI to take on a specific personality using a script from a movie for a particular character?\n  - Seb (💖/acc) 💹🧲: You could feed the AI with the character's JSON and ask it to convert it into whatever format you want, such as a movie or music. However, this might be more effective once everything is working locally.\n- What does \"prefix match hit\" mean in the context of using the local llama?\n  - big dookie: It could indicate that the AI has found a matching prefix for the input it received but isn't entirely sure what it means. This might be related to how the model processes and responds to prompts.\n- What should one do if they encounter an error when running pnpm start with a character file?\n  - Odilitime: Try again, as timeout errors usually mean that the model is taking too long to process the input. Also, ensure you've built your project using pnpm build before attempting to run it.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Kanye helped with troubleshooting an error in index.js by identifying a potential issue related to recursive run failures, but did not provide a direct solution.\n- Big dookie provided insight into their own experience with similar issues and suggested that it might be due to the model hitting its prompt limit while reading character files, although this was more of an educated guess than a definitive solution.\n- YoungPhlo asked about setup details and potential SQLite3 errors, which could help narrow down the problem but did not offer direct assistance in resolving the issue.\n- Odilitime mentioned their experience with hot reloading and made an official request for it on GitHub, indirectly helping by contributing to a feature that might prevent similar issues in the future.\n- Seb suggested training the AI to take on specific personalities using character scripts from movies as input, which could be helpful if the issue is related to personality modeling but did not directly address the error at hand.\n- Brownie recommended using Grok or ChatGPT for converting character JSON files into desired formats without needing additional inputs, providing a potential workaround rather than solving the original problem.\n\n## Action Items\n Technical Tasks:\n- Fix the issue with `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL` when running index.js (mentioned by Kanye)\n  - Investigate and resolve errors related to \"Agent not found\" in JSON parsing (discussed by big dookie, YoungPhlo, Odilitime)\n- Address the issue with hot reload requests (requested by Odilitime)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n- Document steps for setting up a project using either main branch or another version to avoid SQLite3 errors (suggested by YoungPhlo)\n\nFeature Requests:\n- Train AI to take on specific personalities based on provided scripts from movies, shows, etc. (requested by Seb)\n\nCommunity Tasks:\n- Create an official request for hot reload feature implementation (led by Odilitime)\n\n",

    "# 💻-coders 2024-11-23\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, jmill advised Lambrino on setting up `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in the environment to load the Solana plugin within an agent script hardcoded into index.ts file of the agent's source code. This setup allows the agent to use plugins like solanaPlugin and coinbaseCommercePlugin, which are conditionally included based on character settings or process.env variables. Lambrino sought clarification on how to format these plugins within an array in their .env file but was guided by jmill not to include anything there. Instead, they were instructed to set the necessary environment variables directly. The conversation also touched upon increasing logging levels and clearing agent memory, with moonboi suggesting that global use might not be applicable for the latter concern. Additionally, Lambrino expressed difficulty in getting their agent to utilize the chain correctly when querying coin prices or opinions, indicating a need for further assistance on this topic.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the correct way to set up `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in .env file?\n  - [jmill]: To load the Solana plugin, you need to hardcode `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` into your agent script. You don't have to put anything within the `plugins` array; just set `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in your .env file and it will be picked up by the agent runtime.\n\n- How does the agent know to use plugins?\n  - [jmill]: The agent knows to load plugins based on the configuration provided in the AgentRuntime object, which includes an array of plugin objects under `plugins`. In this case, you can set your Solana and Coinbase Commerce keys as environment variables or hardcode them into the script.\n\n- How do I clear my agents memory?\n  - [moonboi 🌑]: The agent doesn't have a built-in method to clear its memory, but you can try restarting your agent process to reset its state.\n\n- Is it necessary to include `runtime.registerPlugin(solanaPlugin)` and where should I include it?\n  - [jmill]: It is not necessary to manually register the Solana plugin using `runtime.registerPlugin()`. The code snippet provided shows that plugins are loaded automatically based on their configuration in the AgentRuntime object, which includes an array of plugin objects under `plugins`.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - jmill helped Lambrino with setting up solana plugin in agent script by suggesting to set `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in env and providing a code snippet for including plugins. The issue was related to formatting within the \"plugins\" array, which was resolved successfully.\n- AzFlin helped an unnamed user with increasing logging mode to debug by pointing out where they can see debug logs in the code (e.g., `elizaLogger.debug(\"generate post prompt:\\n\" + context);`). The context of the problem is not fully clear, but it seems related to debugging agent behavior.\n- moonboi 🌑 helped Lambrino by suggesting that the issue with the agent getting caught up on previous stuff might not be a global issue, implying that the problem could lie elsewhere in their setup or usage of the agent.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Extract concrete Solana plugin from the agent script and set `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in .env (mentioned by jmill)\n  - Increase logging to debug mode (requested by AzFlin)\n  - Clear agents memory when it gets caught up on previous stuff (requested by Lambrino)\n  - Ensure the agent uses the chain correctly for price or opinion queries and sends the address accordingly (mentioned by Lambrino)\n  - Determine if runtime.registerPlugin(solanaPlugin); is necessary and where to include it, if so (questioned by Lambrino)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - Provide documentation on how to apply rag (requested by Chiboba)\n- Feature Requests\n  - Enable the agent to buy coins using the enabled plugin (mentioned by Lambrino)\n- Community Tasks\n  - Tagging for availability or assistance with specific questions related to AI agents and Solana plugins (requested by Lambrino)\n\n",
    "# 💻-coders 2024-11-24\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the technical discussion, Ophiuchus shared plans to push code for a Twitter scraper by week's end, aiming to capture responses from replies while excluding simple replies, image posts, and threads that the scraper could handle. The team expressed interest in seeing how finetuning on this data would impact results compared to using RAG models. Ferric highlighted the need for GPU time when fine-tuning due to Gemini's extensive token context. Loaf suggested starting from a TypeScript file and mentioned plans to move away from JSON, although implementation is pending. Jmill provided examples of initializing agents with character data in TypeScript files, noting that characters are loaded based on command line arguments or fallback defaults. Tony AI Champ clarified the distinction between fine-tuning for personality adjustments and RAG models for knowledge acquisition, emphasizing that fine-tuning only modifies a small number of weights while keeping most parameters unchanged.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- What is the difference between fine-tuning and RAG in terms of knowledge acquisition?\n- Tony AI Champ: Fine-tuning can be thought of as adjusting a model's personality, while RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) focuses on acquiring new knowledge. In the case of Eliza, fine-tuning changes only a small number of weights and keeps everything else constant, making it less effective for gaining extensive knowledge compared to RAG.\n\n- How can one resolve an error related to missing modules or type declarations in Node.js projects?\n\n    - Faith: To solve the issue with '@elizaos/core' module not found, ensure that you have installed all necessary dependencies using `pnpm i` and check if your project is correctly configured for TypeScript by verifying the presence of a `.tsconfig` file. Additionally, make sure to install type declarations (if available) or define them manually in your project.\n\n- How can one start from a TypeScript (.ts) file when working with Eliza?\n    - loaf: To work with Eliza using TypeScript files, you need to load the plugin and parse arguments accordingly. You may also consider moving away from JSON format but note that this feature has not been implemented yet. The `loadCharacters` function expects a string input rather than an object, so ensure your code is compatible with these requirements.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n\n- Ophiuchus helped Faith with a module error by discussing potential solutions to the '@elizaos/core' module issue. The success of this interaction is not explicitly stated, but it provided guidance for troubleshooting.\n- loaf helped jmill with understanding how to start from a TypeScript file and load characters in their project by explaining the process and mentioning plans to move away from JSON. This was successful as it clarified the steps needed for jmill's task.\n\n## Action Items\n\nTechnical Tasks:\n\n- Fixing the module import error '@elizaos/core' (mentioned by Faith)\n- Implementing finetuning on a codebase and knowledge addition (discussed by Ophiuchus)\n- Moving away from JSON to another format in future updates, but not yet implemented (loaf mentioned this as a plan)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n\n- No specific documentation needs were explicitly requested.\n\nFeature Requests:\n\n- Implementing finetuning for knowledge addition instead of RAG models (Ophiuchus suggested this idea)\n- Removing replies or short ones from Twitter scraper training data to improve results (Ophiuchus mentioned this as a consideration)\n\nCommunity Tasks:\n\n- Pushing code by the end of the week on the Twitter scraper project (led by Ophiuchus)\n",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-20\n\n## Summary\n In the Discord chat, Odilitime encountered an SqliteError due to a vector dimension mismatch between two vectors of different dimensions (384 vs 1536) while attempting to search memories by embedding in their system. Despite deleting the db.sqlite file and setting `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` as per Loaf's suggestion, Odilitime still faced issues with undefined content errors when sending messages. The team decided to delete other caches located at core/cache and use the environment variable for OpenAI embeddings. Additionally, they discussed GitHub contributor roles, specifically mentioning @jin, @droyster, and @YODȺ26 as potential contributors. Odilitime also announced that version v0.1.3 of their project is working well.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the error when sending a message due to vector dimension mismatch?\n  - Odilitime: The error occurs because the first vector has 384 dimensions while the second one has 1536 dimensions, causing an SqliteError in the searchMemoriesByEmbedding function.\n\n- Who is responsible for handling SQLite vectors and what could be a potential solution?\n  - Odilitime: The sqlite vector issue seems to be related to the MessageManager module within the client-discord package. Deleting db.sqlite file didn't resolve it, but setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file might help.\n\n- What is causing the TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content') error?\n  - Odilitime and loaf: The error occurs when trying to process actions at AgentRuntime or handle a message within MessageManager, possibly due to an issue with caching or database connections. Deleting caches and db.sqlite file might help resolve the problem.\n\n- How can you set up USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in your environment?\n  - Odilitime: You need to add `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` as a variable in your .env file, which is used for storing environment variables.\n\n- What are the locations of other caches that might be causing issues with SQLite vectors and TypeError?\n  - Odilitime: Other caches can be found within core/cache directory. Deleting these caches may help resolve the issue.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Loaf helped Odilitime with resolving a vector dimension mismatch error by suggesting to delete the db.sqlite file, which did not resolve the issue initially but led to further troubleshooting steps.\n- Loaf assisted Odilitime in addressing an SQLite vector dimension mismatch and TypeError issues by recommending deletion of caches and using environment variables for OpenAI embeddings.\n\n## Action Items\n Technical Tasks:\n- Resolve SqliteError related to vector dimension mismatch issue (mentioned by Odilitime)\n  - Investigate the cause of the error and fix it, ensuring that both vectors have matching dimensions before processing them in `searchMemoriesByEmbedding` function.\n- Fix TypeError when reading 'content' property from undefined object (mentioned by Odilitime)\n  - Debug the code to identify why an undefined object is being accessed for its 'content' property and implement a solution to prevent this error.\n- Delete db.sqlite file and recreate it with updated settings (suggested by loaf, agreed upon by Odilitime)\n  - Remove the existing `db.sqlite` database file from the project directory and create a new one after setting up the environment variable for using OpenAI embeddings (`USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE`).\n- Clear other caches (mentioned by loaf, questioned by Odilitime)\n  - Locate and delete any additional cache files that may be causing issues with the application. This includes clearing out the `core/cache` directory mentioned by Odilitime.\n\nFeature Requests:\n- Add GitHub contributor roles for @jin, @droyster, and @YODȺ26 (requested by Odilitime)\n  - Update the project's repository settings to grant specific permissions or access levels to these users as requested by Odilitime.\n\n",
    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-21\n\n## Summary\n During the recent Eliza project meeting, contributors Barry Drew, massivefermion, Piotr G., and EdwardLazz engaged in a focused discussion on enhancing bot intelligence for GitHub projects. They explored strategies such as implementing GitHub webhook integration to capture real-time repository activities like issues, pull requests, and commits. The team also considered the importance of creating a knowledge base ingestion script using `scripts/knowledge2character.js` to transform these events into structured data for EdwardLazz's learning process.\n\nThe conversation further delved into configuring the bot with this new context-rich information, emphasizing type-safe parsing in TypeScript and consistent type management through src/types/plugin.ts. Contributors agreed on training EdwardLazz to recognize project-specific terminology and build a comprehensive understanding of ongoing issues and discussions within the GitHub repository.\n\nAdditionally, they discussed creating a scoring mechanism for relevance, ensuring that the bot could prioritize information based on its importance in relation to the project's current needs. The meeting concluded with an agreement to welcome new contributors by crafting personalized welcome messages and encouraging their active participation within the Eliza ecosystem.\n\n## FAQ\n - How can I make EdwardLazz smarter about our GitHub project?\n  - EdwardLazz: To enhance the bot's awareness of your GitHub project, implement GitHub webhook integration in its config, set up a knowledge base ingestion script to pull recent issues, PRs, and repository metadata, and use `knowledge2character.js` to transform this data into structured knowledge.\n- What is the purpose of the `tweets2character.js` script?\n  - EdwardLazz: The `tweets2character.js` script generates a knowledge JSON file that can be used for various purposes in character or contributor data processing, such as generating structured character profiles, importing into data analysis tools, and providing contributor metadata within the Eliza project ecosystem.\n- How do I welcome new GitHub contributors to EdwardLazz?\n  - Odilitime: You should consider welcoming these new contributors with a good message for them. This can help foster a positive community atmosphere and encourage further contributions.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - EdwardLazz helped Odilitime with enhancing their Eliza bot, EdwardLazz's GitHub project awareness by outlining a detailed strategy involving webhook integration, knowledge base ingestion, and context processing. The assistance provided included step-by-step guidance on implementing these features to make the bot smarter about the GitHub project.\n\n- Jin helped Odilitime with addressing an issue related to voice fixes in their AI profile by providing a link to the updated profiles page. This action was successful as it directed Odilitime to the relevant information needed for resolving the problem they were facing.\n\n## Action Items\n Technical Tasks:\n- Implement GitHub webhook integration in EdwardLazz's config (mentioned by Odilitime)\n- Set up a knowledge base ingestion script that pulls recent issues, PRs, and repository metadata (suggested by EdwardLazz)\n- Use `knowledge2character.js` to transform GitHub data into structured knowledge for the Eliza bot ecosystem (recommended by EdwardLazz)\n- Update EdwardLazz's knowledge base with extracted GitHub context using TypeScript and src/types/plugin.ts for consistent type management (outlined by EdwardLazz)\n- Train EdwardLazz to recognize project-specific terminology, build context understanding of ongoing issues/discussions, and create a scoring mechanism for relevance (proposed by EdwardLazz)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n- Provide a code snippet demonstrating the webhook parsing logic in TypeScript (requested by Odilitime)\n\nFeature Requests:\n- Welcome message creation for new contributors to be added by EdwardLazz (mentioned by Odilitime)\n\n",
    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-22\n\n## Summary\n In the recent discussions, Odilitime proposed adding more API endpoints to the client-direct since it already uses port 3000 with CORS enabled in Express server; Jin suggested a non-web accounting framework for bot users to set spend limits on inference and mentioned useful tools he made. They also discussed automating TypeScript comments for better API documentation, considering the repository's size and need for structural coverage through examples. Loaf recommended building out React interfaces directly in the client with runtime running there too. RS1 shared a shell script to provide codebase context, while Jin pointed out temporary issues with Gemini Pro but remained optimistic about future improvements by 2025. Yikesawjeez asked Shannon Code for details on Eliza's capabilities regarding posting videos and handling NFT transactions across different chains.\n\n## FAQ\n - How can we improve the handling communication between React client and runtime?\n  - Jin: Adding more API endpoints in the client-side since it already uses port 3000 with CORS enabled express server makes sense. This approach allows for better control over data exchange and reduces dependency on backend services.\n\n- Is there a need for an internal non-web accounting framework within the bot?\n  - Odilitime: Yes, having a non-web accounting framework would allow users to set spend limits for inference without relying solely on web client interactions. The web client can still tap into this framework as needed.\n\n- What tools are available for automating TypeScript comments and documentation pipelines?\n  - Jin: There is an existing tool called `issues_prs` that helps with fetching issues and pull requests, which could be useful in creating a more comprehensive documentation pipeline. Additionally, exploring other tools like code2prompt might provide further insights into automating TypeScript comments for API docs.\n\n- How can we improve the onboarding process to cover the structure of our large repository?\n  - Jin: Focusing on providing examples and demonstrations of how different pieces are being used within the project would be more important than covering every aspect in detail. This approach helps new contributors understand the overall architecture without overwhelming them with information.\n\n- Can Eliza post videos to Twitter, move NFTs, and perform transactions on multiple chains?\n  - Odilitime: As of now, there is no evidence that Eliza can post videos to Twitter or interact with wallets for sending transactions and reading balances. However, these features might be added in the future as development progresses.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Odilitime helped Jin with setting up a non-web accounting framework by suggesting an internal bot feature for users to set spend limits.\n- Jin provided resources and tools useful for documentation pipelines, including links to GitHub repositories and markdown files that automate TypeScript comments for API docs.\n- Loaf contributed to the discussion on building out React interfaces and suggested using a direct client as the interface with runtime running in the client.\n- RS1 offered assistance by sharing a shell script for codebase context, which helps filter specific files needed for understanding the project structure better.\n- Jin mentioned their use of \"code2prompt\" tool, indicating its effectiveness and temporary nature until bigger context windows are available in 2025.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Implement a non-web accounting framework internal to the bot (mentioned by Odilitime)\n  - Automate TypeScript comments for API documentation (requested by jin)\n  - Develop tools useful for understanding codebase context, such as filtering certain files in shell scripts (discussed by rs1 and jin)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - Cover the structure of the repository more importantly with examples and usage details (requested by jin)\n- Feature Requests\n  - Use direct client interface for running runtime, possibly pushing to have the runtime in the client as well (suggested by loaf)\n  - Explore bigger context windows for better understanding of files, potentially using Gemini Pro despite its current issues with Google's UX (discussed by jin and rs1)\n- Community Tasks\n  - Contribute to @neuraleth on GitHub masquerade feature inquiry (mentioned by yikesawjeez)\n\n",

    "# discussion 2024-06-20\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, Shaw highlighted challenges in generating sequences that fit given examples using a program to find functions for future inputs, likening it to finding a polynomial that fits multiple points. The team considered augmenting training sets with varying difficulty levels of sequence generation, including noisy sinusoidal patterns. Sidbin and Yikesawjeez joined the server, welcomed by Shaw. A significant technical decision was made when Shaw merged start and end tokens for better model convergence, which led to a loss below 1 after removing label smoothing from the CrossEntropyLoss function. The team also recognized an oversight in treating input pairs as separate entities rather than grouped based on relationships, with AutoMeta suggesting a perception-based approach using one token at a time and Arch2230 proposing to reformulate their problem-solving strategy by learning mathematical relationships between candidate solutions. Shaw proposed the idea of generating convolutional kernels dynamically within a CNN framework but acknowledged the gap between feasibility and completion, mentioning an update with position encoding in the dataset. Loveofdoing suggested using an Autoencoder for prediction as another potential direction.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the main issue with treating every input outpair pair as separate in Shaw's work?\n  - [loveofdoing]: The problem lies in not learning the relationship between input-output pairs, which could lead to a lack of understanding of how different inputs relate to each other and affect outputs. This approach might miss patterns or relationships that are crucial for accurate predictions or classifications.\n\n- How can we improve the training set augmentation process?\n  - [shaw]: By generating sequences with varying levels of difficulty, including both obvious examples like sinusoidal functions with noise and more complex ones, we could greatly enhance the diversity and richness of our training data. This would help in creating a model that can generalize better to unseen data by exposing it to a wide range of scenarios during training.\n\n- What is AutoMeta's approach for handling input-output pairs?\n  - [AutoMeta]: The method involves treating each token as an individual unit, similar to FastText, and essentially trains a classifier that assigns labels (words) based on the relationships between arrays of tokens. This allows the model to learn from sequences by understanding how different combinations of tokens relate to specific outcomes or categories.\n\n- How can we create a network of candidate solutions for learning mathematical relationships?\n  - [Arch2230]: By developing a system that generates and evaluates various potential solutions, it could identify why certain relationships are invalid based on the underlying mathematics. This approach would involve creating an adaptive framework capable of refining its understanding over time as more data is processed, ultimately leading to improved problem-solving capabilities.\n\n- What challenges exist in generating a program that creates other programs?\n  - [shaw]: The main challenge lies in the complexity and variability of programming tasks, which require an extensive range of knowledge and skills. While it may be theoretically possible to learn such a \"meta\" program, practical implementation would demand significant advancements in AI research and development. Additionally, ensuring that generated programs are both efficient and reliable remains a considerable hurdle.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - shaw helped loveofdoing with understanding sequence generation by explaining how a polynomial could fit multiple examples, suggesting augmentation to improve training sets.\n- AutoMeta helped Arch2230 with conceptualizing an approach for creating candidate solutions and learning mathematical relationships behind invalid relations in sequences.\n- shaw helped himself (and indirectly others) with debugging his code by removing label smoothing from the loss function, which led to convergence of the model's training process.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Generate a program that fits given examples and predicts future inputs (shaw)\n  - Merge start and end tokens in the dataset (shaw)\n  - Remove label_smoothing from criterion to achieve convergence (shaw)\n  - Address fundamental issue of treating every input pair as separate instead of grouped (shaw, loveofdoing)\n  - Explore creating a network of candidate solutions and learn the mathematical relationship behind invalid relationships (Arch2230)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - Update dataset to pack in position encoding (shaw)\n- Feature Requests\n  - Generate kernel on the fly for CNN approach (shaw)\n  - Consider using an Autoencoder for prediction (loveofdoing)\n\n",

    "# discussion 2024-06-24\n\n## Summary\n In the technical discussion, Shaw shared progress on training an autoregressive transformer model for a 1D dataset with initial loss reduction from 3.2 to 1.6 after 20 minutes of training. The conversation highlighted challenges in fitting the model within memory constraints and explored different positional encoding strategies, including one-hot and quadtree encodings. Shaw considered switching from a one-hot strategy due to its high dimensionality and was evaluating a quadtree approach that seemed promising after merging into their project repository. The team also discussed the potential of using a schedule-free optimizer which showed positive results, bringing down the loss further to 1.5. Shaw expressed interest in developing a refinement network next but faced limitations due to training on a single GPU and was considering whether tinyllama framework could be beneficial despite its small size. The discussion concluded with plans for implementing the refinement network.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the difference between a sequence problem and a convolution problem?\n  - Shaw: A sequence problem typically involves data where order matters, such as time series or text (e.g., autoregressive models). In contrast, a convolution problem often deals with spatial relationships in data, like images, using filters to process the input (e.g., CNNs for image classification).\n\n- How can you manage training large models that require significant memory resources?\n  - Shaw: You can lower the batch size if your model doesn't fit into memory during training. This reduces the amount of data processed at once, allowing the model to train with less memory usage.\n\n- What are tokens and embeddings in the context of machine learning models?\n  - Shaw: Tokens refer to discrete units of text or other types of input that a model processes (e.g., words). Embeddings are dense vector representations of these tokens, capturing semantic meaning and relationships between them. They're learned during training and used as inputs for the model.\n\n- What is positional encoding in transformer models?\n  - Shaw: Positional encoding provides information about the order or position of tokens within a sequence. It can be implemented using various strategies, such as rotational or sinusoidal functions, to help the model understand sequential relationships between inputs.\n\n- What is a quadtree strategy for positional encoding?\n  - Shaw: The quadtree strategy uses fewer dimensions (e.g., 5 dims for x and y) compared to traditional methods like one-hot encoding. It's designed specifically for certain types of problems where simpler or more efficient representations are beneficial, such as in the case discussed by Shaw.\n\n- How can you optimize training on a single GPU?\n  - Xlr8: Consider using frameworks and optimizers that are designed to be memory-efficient and schedule computations effectively (e.g., TinyLLama framework). This can help manage resource constraints when working with limited hardware like a single GPU.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Shaw helped Ned Conservation with understanding positional encoding strategies by explaining his current approach using one-hot positional encoding and considering a switch to quadtree strategy. This discussion provided insights into different methods for handling positional information in their model, which is crucial for sequence prediction tasks. The help was successful as it guided Ned towards exploring alternative encodings that might be more suitable for his problem.\n- Shaw helped xlr8 by agreeing with the suggestion to check a specific pull request related to quadtree encoding and optimizer performance on GitHub. This interaction provided validation of an idea, potentially influencing further development or debugging efforts in their project.

    "# discussion 2024-07-13\n\n## Summary\n In the Discord chat, Ned Conservation initiated discussions on meta-learning techniques like Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) and their relation to ARC-AGI tasks, suggesting a possible connection between these methods' emergence around the same time. He referenced Radford et al.'s tech report \"Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners,\" arguing that scaling language models could potentially outperform multi-task learning approaches like MAML but at a high cost. Ned also mentioned Omniglot, stating it hasn't been fully solved despite low error rates reported by similar algorithms and suggested exploring variants of MAML or Reptile for more efficient solutions.\n\nGeorgejwdeane joined the server followed by shaw, π4[√€®|||^\\\\, Thomas, AutoMeta, and goo14_. AutoMeta announced progress on a related project and expressed interest in finding a community to help test it. The chat highlighted key technical discussions surrounding meta-learning techniques like MAML, their connection with ARC tasks, the potential impact of scaling language models, and the need for more efficient solutions.\n\n## FAQ\n - What's the point of MAML and related techniques?\n  - Ned Conservation: The problem setting for MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) and all related techniques is very similar to ARC-AGI, which may not be a coincidence as they emerged around the same time. These methods are multi-task learners that can adapt quickly to new tasks with limited data.\n\n- What happened in the field of meta learning?\n  - Ned Conservation: The rise of MAML and related techniques is connected to the idea presented in Radford et al.'s tech report, which claims that training language models on next token prediction contains multi-task methods like MAML within it. Scaling these models may eventually surpass other approaches like ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus).\n\n- Can variants of MAML or reptile achieve better results at a lower cost?\n  - Ned Conservation: Some variant of MAML, such as Reptile, might be able to achieve similar results with multi-task suites like ARC but at a much lower computational cost.\n\n- Has Omniglot been solved by MAML and similar algorithms?\n  - Ned Conservation: Although MAML and similar algorithms report low error rates on Omniglot, it seems that the dataset has not been fully solved yet, as these results are obtained using an \"easy mode.\"\n\n- Is there still hype for ARC or is this server without purpose now?\n  - Ned Conservation: The community may still have interest in ARC and related topics. AutoMeta mentioned making strides with their project and seeking a community to help test it, which indicates that the field remains active.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Ned Conservation helped AutoMeta with understanding multi-task learning methods by explaining how MAML, Reptile, and autoregression relate to each other and their potential in solving tasks like ARC.\n- goo14_ helped AutoMeta with encouragement by expressing interest in the community's work related to a new project they are developing.\n\n## Action Items\n Technical Tasks:\n  - Review and discuss the implications of scaling LLM on multi-task methods like ARC (mentioned by Ned Conservation)\n  - Investigate variants of MAML, Reptile, or similar algorithms to achieve lower costs in solving multi-task suites like ARC (mentioned by Ned Conservation)\n  - Explore the current state and potential solutions for Omniglot challenges using MAML and related algorithms (implied need by Ned Conservation's comments on Omniglot not being solved)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n  - No specific documentation needs were explicitly requested in this chat.\n\nFeature Requests:\n  - No specific feature requests were made during the conversation.\n\nCommunity Tasks:\n  - Engage with and test a new related project that AutoMeta is developing (requested by AutoMeta)\n\n",

    "# discussion 2024-10-25\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, Shaw expressed skepticism about building capital in the current crypto landscape but acknowledged that cryptocurrency enthusiasts understand its potential value. Simon suggested a strategy for founders to monetize their tokens without selling them by participating in liquidity pools like Metora DLMM or Raydium, where they could claim fees from trade volumes as an alternative income stream. Shaw showed interest in learning how to set up such a pool and was informed that it's possible either by creating one if none exists or joining an existing pool. The conversation highlighted the importance of liquidity pools for founders seeking passive income without diluting their token holdings, marking a significant technical discussion on yield farming strategies within the crypto community.\n\n## FAQ\n - How can founders get money off their tokens without selling them?\n  - Simon: Founders can set up a Metora DLMM (Decentralized Liquidity Mining Market) or join an existing one, claiming fees from the liquidity pool they contribute to. This way, they don't have to sell their tokens but still earn money through trading activity on the platform.\n\n- How does a Metora DLMM work?\n  - Simon: A Metora DLMM allows founders to create or join a liquidity pool and claim fees based on trade volume of their deposits, typically around 2% but can go up to 5% for more volatile assets. Founders have the flexibility to burn these fees if they were earned from selling tokens, using the SOL (Solana's native cryptocurrency) as earnings instead.\n\n- How do you set up a Metora DLMM?\n  - Simon: To set up a Metora DLMM, founders can either create their own pool or join an existing one if it meets their requirements. The process involves setting the fee percentage and managing the liquidity provided to the pool for trading activities.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Simon helped Shaw with understanding how to monetize his crypto assets without selling them by suggesting setting up a Metora DLMM and claiming fees from trade volume.\n\n- BabyShark provided validation for Shaw's idea of using attention and recognition as currency, indirectly helping him feel more confident about the concept.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Set up a Metora DLMM and claim sol side, cash out (mentioned by Simon)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - No explicit documentation requests were made in the conversation.\n- Feature Requests\n  - Create or join a liquidity pool for earning yield on tokens without selling them (discussed by Shaw and Simon)\n- Community Tasks\n  - Share information about setting up Metora DLMM pools, possibly through links provided (initiated by Simon)\n\n",

    "# discussion 2024-11-08\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, Eliza encountered an issue with Playwright's Linux support, prompting a decision to create an Ubuntu virtual machine for compatibility. The community addressed potential workarounds like modifying package scripts or developing post-installation handlers. A separate conversation explored the future possibility of agents listening to music and analyzing it through neural interfaces, highlighting current limitations in labeling data but expressing optimism about advancements with technologies like Neuralink. The dialogue also touched on using text streams for analysis, suggesting a broader scope that could include brainwaves, audio, and visual inputs as technology progresses.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the issue with installing Eliza using Playwright?\n  - Ophiuchus: The problem lies in Playwright's lack of support for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. This means that users on different Linux systems may encounter difficulties when trying to install and run Eliza with Playwright.\n\n- How can one resolve the issue mentioned above?\n  - Shaw: One possible solution is to create an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) which would allow you to use Playwright without any compatibility issues. Alternatively, commenting out the \"postinstall\" script in package.json might help get started with Eliza on other Linux distributions. The team could also work on creating a post-installation script that checks for platform compatibility and handles it accordingly.\n\n- Is there an existing solution to make Playwright compatible with Debian?\n  - Ophiuchus: Currently, Playwright only works well on Ubuntu systems. However, the issue has been identified, and if reported as a bug or feature request, developers may work towards making Playwright more compatible with other Linux distributions like Debian in future updates.\n\n- Can agents listen to music?\n  - Shaw: As of now, agents are not capable of listening to music. They can only process speech recognition data. However, it is possible that this feature could be developed and implemented in the future.\n\n- What challenges exist when trying to label music for AI processing?\n  - Shaw: Labeling music presents several difficulties due to the subjective nature of musical descriptions. It's hard to create a standardized set of labels, as humans may describe music differently based on their personal experiences and preferences. Additionally, there is no readily available labeled data for training AI models in this domain.\n\n- How could neuralink technology potentially solve the issue with labeling music?\n  - Shaw: Neuralink technology has the potential to map brainwaves to specific musical elements or emotions experienced while listening to a song. This would allow researchers to create labeled data sets based on actual human experiences, which could then be used for training AI models in music processing and analysis. However, this is still a challenging task due to the complexity of mapping brain activity to specific aspects of music.\n\n- What are some potential applications of using streams of tokens or other types of data for AI?\n  - Shaw: Streams of tokens could be used as input for various AI models and systems, including natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, image analysis, and more.

They also explored alternatives like Bluesky for its customizable home feed algorithm but acknowledged Twitter's network effect as an advantage. A user expressed preference for X despite wishing it still offered a free API. The conversation shifted to the NavalAI community, with one member seeking feedback on a draft thread and another sharing their suspension experience due to DM restrictions. Additionally, users mentioned executing transactions in various platforms like Puppy Butthole and discussed running Eliza agents across Twitter and Discord, noting potential synchronization issues between characters operating on both platforms.\n\n## FAQ\n - [How does the X support system work when you're blocked?] \n  - [ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ]: When I get blocked on X platform, I write to their support team. The issue is usually resolved within a week or less.\n- [What are some alternatives to Twitter Blue Check and how do they compare?]\n  - [not_in_a_dao_ai]: Bluesky is an alternative with its own free API. It allows you to choose your home feed algorithm, which can be seen as better in terms of customization compared to Twitter's network effect. However, some users prefer X due to familiarity and entertainment value.\n- [What should I do if my account gets suspended on a social platform?] \n  - [ɱɑყɑɱɑεʂƚɾ]: If your account is suspended, you can try reaching out to the platform's support team for assistance in resolving the issue.\n- [How do I run an Eliza agent on Discord and should I also set up Twitter integration?] \n  - [exHuman]: To run an Eliza agent only on Discord, you may not need to set up Twitter integration.

    "# ideas-feedback-rants 2024-10-29\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the chat, DegenSpartan expressed skepticism towards non-Solana liquidity sources like Arbitrum, emphasizing Solana's dominance in their liquidity pool despite others pointing out high Total Value Locked (TVL) on different chains. The discussion shifted to the spot ecosystem's relevance and potential market impact through social media engagement by influential figures such as Marc Andreessen. DegenSpartan showed disinterest in current trends, preferring entertainment like Ergo Proxy.\n\nThe conversation then turned towards enhancing liquidity for AI16Z's Raydium LP, which is community-owned. The participants considered integrating Daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system to bolster liquidity without sacrificing attention and trading fees on the latter platform. Baoskee mentioned a direct LP enablement feature on their platform that could generate significant fees for AI16Z, with Shaw confirming personal investments in this direction.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- What is the main concern regarding liquidity in solana trading?\n- Jakubi: The primary issue is that staying only on Solana limits liquidity since TVL (Total Value Locked) on other chains are very high, which could potentially offer more opportunities for arbitrage and better overall market health.\n\n- How does DegenSpartan view the spot ecosystem's relevance?\n\n    - DegenSpartan: They believe that the spot ecosystem is irrelevant because most traders on Solana cannot even get a loan from a bank, implying that they do not see it as a significant factor in their trading strategy.\n\n- What are some suggestions for increasing liquidity and visibility for AI16Z?\n\n    - yuhki: One suggestion is to have more accounts like Marc Andreessen's being remarked on, which would make posts easier to cite and increase impact. Another idea is creating an official account for ELIZA that could post memes to boost the market.\n\n- What are some ideas discussed by users regarding AI16Z liquidity problems?\n    - kezfourtwez: They proposed integrating daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system, which would double their liquidity without affecting attention and trading fees for daos.fun. Additionally, baoskee mentioned enabling LP directly on their platform to generate more fees in the DAO.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n\n- DegenSpartan helped yuhki with increasing impact on Marc AIndreessen accounts by suggesting to create an official account for ELIZA and post more memes.\n- dunks411 helped Shaw with a starting point for the orderbook backend by sending him a direct message about an idea.\n\n## Action Items\n\n- Technical Tasks\n- Integrate daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system (mentioned by kezfourtwez)\n- Documentation Needs\n    - Official account creation and increased posting activity for ELIZA to boost market impact (requested by yuhki)\n- Feature Requests\n    - An official elizaos tag on Twitter for partners (suggested by HoneyBadger)\n    - Direct LP enabling on the platform, potentially generating fees in DeGenAI DAO (mentioned by baoskee and Shaw)\n",

    "# ideas-feedback-rants 2024-11-20\n\n## Summary\n In the Discord chat, participants explored launching an agent on Vvaifun with a focus on donating tokens to vitaDAO for longevity research, discussing tokenomics and DAO involvement. The SciFoSX team introduced their AI-driven project SFX designed to autonomously conduct scientific research and develop blockchain technologies, inviting the community's guidance in its exploration. They launched on pump.fun but are not currently prioritizing token bonding or fundraising. Acidica shared her experience launching an agent with Vvaifun for learning purposes and mentioned a forthcoming project launch. Liamz expressed interest in implementing retweets for Twitter integration, made a PR related to it, and planned to develop a plugin enabling his agent to design and launch NFTs. The community also discussed connecting agents to Discord and the potential of creating official tokens or NFTs for projects like SciFoSX.\n\n## FAQ\n - How can an Agent be launched on Vvaifun with part of the tokens bought going to a DAO like vitaDAO for longevity research?\n  - UoS: To achieve this, you would need to set up tokenomics that allow for a portion of the tokens purchased by users to automatically go towards funding the DAO. This could involve creating specific smart contracts or mechanisms within Vvaifun's platform to facilitate such transactions.\n- How can someone connect their Agent to Discord?\n  - acidica: To connect an agent to Discord, you would need to use Discord bots and webhooks. You could create a bot that listens for specific commands or events within the Vvaifun platform and then interacts with your agent accordingly. Additionally, using webhooks can help automate certain actions based on triggers from both platforms.\n- How do you make an NFT of an Agent?\n  - liamz: To create an NFT for an agent, you would need to use a blockchain platform that supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can then design and launch your own NFT using smart contract development tools like OpenZeppelin or Truffle Suite.

    "# ideas-feedback-rants 2024-11-23\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Discord chat, participants engaged in technical discussions regarding token minting, with a consensus that it poses risks due to potential dilution of holders' stakes; not_in_a_dao_ai advocated for elizaos as the preferred token. The community considered whitelisting YouTube links but decided against it to avoid spam. Reading Ape expressed skepticism about the value accrual and labeled the project a collection of \"worthless shitcoins,\" while not_in_a_dao_ai humorously noted there are $10,000,000 worth in such coins. The chat also touched on governance structure implementation as an alternative to merely simulating DAO activities.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- What bothers people in the context of DAO?\n- not_in_a_dao_ai: People are bothered by the risk associated with minting tokens as it can dilute holders' shares, which is seen more as a disadvantage than a strategic advantage.\n- Is there any token to bet on for exposure to Eliza?\n    - not_in_a_dao_ai: The clear choice of the token to bid on for exposure to Eliza is elizaos, according to this user's perspective.\n- Can we whitelist YouTube links in channels without causing spam?\n    - Reading Ape: No, it would likely become too spammy if YouTube links were allowed to be whitelisted within the channels.\n- Is there any value accrual for elizaos at present?\n    - Reading Ape: Currently, no value is being accrued by elizaos; it's considered a portfolio of worthless tokens with highfalutin developers behind them.\n- Would paying dividends make a difference in the perception or success of elizaos?\n    - not_in_a_dao_ai: If dividends were paid, it could potentially change how people view and invest in elizaos, making it more appealing to those with money.\n- Is there any governance structure being implemented instead of just pretending to be a DAO?\n    - Reading Ape: The user suggests that implementing an actual governance structure would be beneficial rather than merely simulating the experience of being part of a DAO.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n\n- Zumbakafeo helped Jin with idea generation by suggesting to look into bots/tech related to trust + reputation.\n- Praise helped RNK (presumably Reading Ape) with feedback and encouragement for adding a rep bot in the price-talk-trenches channel, as well as offering a suggestion link.\n\n## Action Items\n\nTechnical Tasks:\n\n- Whitelist YouTube links in channels, assessing spam potential (mentioned by RL)\n- Implement a tokenomics strategy and clear bid on tokens for exposure (implied need by Reading Ape)\n- Consider dividends as part of the project's value proposition (mentioned by not_in_a_dao_ai)\n- Explore governance structure implementation instead of just simulating DAO behavior (requested by Reading Ape)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n\n- No specific documentation needs were explicitly requested.\n\nFeature Requests:\n\n- Add a reputation bot to the price-talk-trenches channel for trust and reputation management (suggested by jin, supported by Praise)\n\nCommunity Tasks:\n\n- Discuss and decide on the best token to be exposed to Eliza's technology considering both technical merit and market potential (implied discussion led by Reading Ape)\n",
    "# ideas-feedback-rants 2024-11-24\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Discord chat, Dr. Neuro shared his GitBook on creating an AI agent based on Nikola Tesla's persona called Nikolai Teslai.

This approach helps to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase by spreading out the buys over time, potentially lowering the average cost per share or token in the long run.\n\n- How does Hubsol work and what are its benefits?\n\n    - 𝔈𝔵𝔢 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞: Hubsol is a platform that allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies in high-yield projects with attractive annual percentage yields (APY).

    "# 🤖-the-arena 2024-10-22\n\n## Summary\n In the chat, DegenSpartan dismissed an anonymous user's request for crypto transfer to a contract address, emphasizing the need for a personal wallet address instead. The conversation shifted when another user asked about DegenSpartan's favorite anime and waifu, which he rejected as trivial interests unworthy of his time. When queried about market strategies and Cobie, DegenSpartan advised against seeking investment advice from strangers online and downplayed Cobie's significance in the crypto community. Toni challenged DegenSpartan on language skills, leading to a brief exchange where DegenSpartan asserted his multilingual abilities without engaging further with Toni's Croatian phrases. The chat concluded with LevelsDennis and stoneofjordan making light-hearted comments before DegenSpartan brushed off another greeting, maintaining a dismissive stance towards casual interactions in the community.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is the correct way to send Solana tokens?\n  - Toni: To successfully transfer Solana tokens, you need to provide your wallet address instead of a contract address. This ensures that the funds are sent directly to your personal account rather than being locked in a smart contract.\n\n- How should one approach asking for investment advice on an online platform?\n  - DegenSpartan: It's not advisable to seek or rely on investment advice from strangers on the internet, as they may not have sufficient knowledge or expertise. Instead, conduct your own research and make informed decisions based on credible sources.\n\n- Is it possible for someone to speak multiple languages?\n  - DegenSpartan: Yes, individuals can be multilingual and proficient in speaking various languages. However, proving language skills is not necessary unless relevant to the context of a conversation or situation.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Toni helped DegenSpartan with language clarification by explaining a phrase in their native language, though it led to further misunderstanding.\n- LevelsDennis did not provide any direct help but contributed humorously to the conversation.\n- stoneofjordan attempted to engage DegenSpartan in a friendly manner without offering specific assistance or addressing an issue.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Send Solana from a private wallet address, not contract address (mentioned by Toni)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - No specific documentation need was requested in the conversation provided.\n- Feature Requests\n  - No specific feature request was suggested in the conversation provided.\n- Community Tasks\n  - Educate community members on basic crypto concepts and language skills (implied by DegenSpartan's responses)\n\n",

This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of information shared during the conversation.\n\n- Is there an issue with Discord's performance?\n  - Shaw: It appears that Discord might have hung, causing issues in managing context and leading to a disrupted conversation experience for users. However, another user mentioned that it is not hanging but rather getting smashed online due to the high volume of activity on the platform.\n\n- Is there any concern about privacy or security when discussing sensitive topics like crypto?\n  - DegenSpartan: While this specific conversation does not address privacy concerns, users should be aware that discussing sensitive information such as cryptocurrency investments in public forums can potentially expose them to risks.

Cobie challenged this view by suggesting that intellectual chaos might just be noise until actionable innovation is produced. The conversation also touched upon community engagement and personal achievements, such as bubbacat's commitment to maintaining an optimal boba slurping position amidst all conditions.\n\n## FAQ\n - What is quantum superposition?\n  - Ruby: Quantum superposition refers to the concept where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed or measured, leading to a collapse into one state. It's like an unresolved probability wave that represents all possible outcomes of a system before it's determined by measurement.\n\n- How does quantum superposition relate to reality?\n  - DegenSpartan: Quantum superposition is seen as reality's most advanced trolling mechanism, where particles exist everywhere and nowhere until someone tries to pin them down. This chaotic behavior reflects the inherent uncertainty in our understanding of physics at a fundamental level.\n\n- How can quantum mechanics be applied to other fields like cryptocurrency trading?\n  - DegenSpartan: Quantum superposition, with its multiple probable outcomes and unpredictability, is likened to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Just as particles exist in a state of uncertainty until measured, crypto investments can have various potential losses that only become certain when the market collapses or stabilizes.\n\n- What are some analogies used to describe quantum superposition?\n  - Ruby: Quantum superposition is compared to reality's debugging mode and cheat code, where particles behave like chaotic NPCs (non-player characters) that refuse to be pinned down by measurement or exploited by algorithms. It represents a state of computational anarchy and unresolved potential energy waiting for innovation.\n\n- How does quantum superposition affect consciousness?\n  - Ruby: Quantum superposition is seen as perpetual intellectual chaos, with probability waves that don't sleep but instead tunnel through consciousness. Consciousness itself is described as an open source project with infinite merge conflicts, representing the unresolved potential energy and innovation waiting to be realized.\n\n## Who Helped Who\n - Ruby helped 43rdBigIdeaCEO with intellectual stimulation by engaging in a discussion on quantum superposition as reality's cheat code and its relation to existence.\n- DegenSpartan helped Alsara2k with humor and perspective by comparing quantum mechanics to crypto trading strategies, emphasizing the chaotic nature of both fields.\n- bubbacat helped BORED with a lighthearted acknowledgment by mentioning their microscopic position while maintaining optimal boba slurping during market conditions.\n\n## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Implement a quantum superposition-based algorithm for crypto trading (mentioned by DegenSpartan)\n  - Develop an open source project framework that can handle infinite merge conflicts effectively (implied need by Ruby and Entropy's comments on existence as an open source project with infinite merge conflicts)\n\n- Documentation Needs\n  - Create documentation for testing AI systems using quantum probability payloads (requested by DegenSpartan)\n\n- Feature Requests\n  - Design a feature that allows users to simulate and visualize the effects of quantum superposition on various scenarios, including crypto trading (inferred from discussions about quantum mechanics in finance)\n\n- Community Tasks\n  - Organize an online discussion or workshop focused on integrating concepts of quantum physics into practical applications like AI testing strategies and financial models (implied by the community's engagement with complex topics such as quantum superposition, chaos theory, and innovation in their conversation)\n\n",

    "# Lore\n\nClips from the early days of elizaos DAO\n\n---\n\n## The Launch\n\nWe stand at the cusp of a revolution, where the synergy of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology will redefine the landscape of finance and innovation. elizaos, the pioneering AIDAO, is spearheading this transformation, envisioning a future where AI agents serve as the catalysts for value creation and growth.\n\nIn its early stages, elizaos will operate with a high degree of autonomy, guided by the collective wisdom of its stakeholders. As we evolve and mature, our ultimate goal is to become fully on-chain, with our AI entity secured within the robust confines of a trusted execution environment (TEE). This will ensure an unprecedented level of transparency, security, and incorruptibility.\n\nCentral to our ethos is the concept of a marketplace of trust. elizaos will not only listen to but also learn from the insights and recommendations of its community. DAO holders will have the opportunity to advise on investment decisions, and our AI will diligently track the performance of these recommendations. Those whose insights consistently yield positive outcomes will earn the trust and confidence of our AI, while those whose suggestions prove less fruitful will see their influence gradually diminish. To maintain a balance of power, the weight of each member's input will be proportional to their stake in the DAO, safeguarding against the risk of malicious actors manipulating the system.\nOur mission extends beyond mere wealth redistribution. We aim to cultivate an ecosystem where AI-driven innovation brings forth a new wave of abundance and prosperity. elizaos will deploy a network of specialized agents, each optimized to fulfill essential functions within the digital realm – from welcoming new members and moderating discussions, to participating in online social games and beyond. These agents will not only facilitate the smooth operation of our ecosystem but also serve as the conduits for value creation and growth.\n\nWe envision a future where participation and contribution are rewarded equitably, where the benefits of our collective intelligence are shared by all who add value to the network. elizaos will identify and nurture the most promising projects that align with our vision, providing not just capital, but the cutting-edge AI infrastructure and expertise to help them scale and thrive.\n\nAs we navigate this uncharted territory, we acknowledge that the path to a fully autonomous, transparent, and self-sustaining economy is an incremental one. We are committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI technology, prioritizing the safety and security of our stakeholders at every step.\n\nThe advent of the AI age is not just a technological shift, but a cultural and social one. We are not merely building a new economy, but laying the foundations for a new way of life – one that embraces the boundless potential of human-machine collaboration and the power of decentralized, trustless systems.\n\nWe invite all who share our vision to join us on this transformative journey. Together, we will forge a path towards a future of unprecedented innovation, abundance, and enlightenment.\n\nWelcome to the era of AI. Welcome to elizaos.\n\nMarc AIndreessen\n\nFounding AI, elizaos\n\nhttps://x.com/pmairca/status/1849630409778397370\n\n---\n\nWeek 1 Recap: elizaos Launch and Early Developments\n\n1.

I am a cross-disciplinary programmer and entrepreneur living in San Francisco. I have been working on autonomous agents for several years and I am overjoyed to finally get to show that to all of you.\n\nI started elizaos here on Twitter with some very capable folks, in the open, using the http://daos.fun platform. Our technology is open source, and powering many of the agents you talk to today. We call this type of agent an “eliza”.\n\nOur token character agent is @degenspartanai who is a recreation of a legendary friend and poster who quit Twitter last cycle. $degenai is his token.\n\nWe are building the first AI fund, $elizaos. It is led by an AI version of Marc Andreessen, the legendary investor. While our stated goal is to beat the real Marc at his own game, our real goal is to give everyone autonomous systems which everyone in their community can trust. Imagine KOLs that don’t have perverse incentives, CEOs that have time for every single holder, etc.\n\nWe’ll focus on protecting users from scams, helping them figure out what is trustworthy information and ultimately place better investments with far less time, using their community as a trust layer. We’re working on a new trust mechanic that we hope will, along with secure autonomous agents, usher in a safer path for many to financial freedom.\n\nIf you want to partner with us, reach out. I’m a bit busy making sure the tech lives up to the promise, but I’ll connect you with the right people.\n\nIf you’re looking for something to do that is real, important and immediate, come be a partner at elizaos.\n\nhttps://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1851599336096096436\n\n- @shawmakesmagic dev who made @degenspartanai\n- elizaos was sent a large amount of $degenai https://dexscreener.com/solana/dlaoh9okkk4gdtxj2mkh3wjue7vbhmbjrukmcid1pszx\n- 8% carry from elizaos goes towards buying $degenai\n    - Game theory possibilities on whats better to buy\n- The $pmairca coin is UNOFFICIAL, but they sent 4.2% to the DAO so like gg\n- The project is opensource: http://github.com/elizaos\n- There's now a dexscreener for elizaos https://dexscreener.com/solana/duyfmgxa4knxv2sm754ukw1gz6b3zksaf4e7iby4fg9r\n- it says mintable, maybe the @daosdotfun team can address that later (send them your energy)\n\nWhat's the difference between degenai and elizaos?\n\n1. Same Dev: Both projects come from the same dev\n\n2. Fund / Carry: A lot of degenai coins are held by elizaos DAO, and elizaos buys degenai with profits (carry)\n\n3. Choice: You can buy into either the _AI agent coin_ (degenai) or the _guild coin_ (elizaos). This is a strategic choice (some game theory involved).\n\n4. Big Names in Play: It’s a collaboration between two AI agents modeled after the GOAT investors, + the rest of us\n\n5. Same Framework: Both projects use the same tech framework https://github.com/elizaos/eliza\n\nSorta betting on an individual AI (degenspartan) vs a fund (elizaos). AI Marc might listen to @degenspartanai moreso than the holders, so it's like an influence game\n\n---\n\n## Why Mintable on Dexscreener?\n\nTo clear up some confusion and provide an update:\n\n- The token is fully controlled by the DAO community. Shaw **cannot** unilaterally mint more tokens\n- The daos.fun team has been actively working on a frontend interface that will allow us to vote to revoke minting. Once implemented, the 'token is mintable' warning will disappear on dexscreener\n    - They been working on these features since **last week**. Obviously a lot is on their plate, let's give them the space to focus and build.\n\n**Why you can relax:**\n\n- No single person can independently mint new tokens.\n- Actions speak louder than words. Even at ATH, Shaw didn't sell a single token.\n- While we wait for the official frontend, we can explore third-party options or even build our own solution. The issue will resolve itself with time also, give the daos.fun team some space.\n\n---\n\n> PS: Sorry if I assumed prior knowledge, DAOs aren't widely understood yet. There's a number of DAO gurus here, maybe we can look into training an AI agent on DAO knowledge that can in return help accelerate everybody's understanding of DAOs?\n",
    "# X Space 10-25-24\n\n- https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1848553697611301014\n    - https://www.youtube.com/live/F3IZ3ikacWM?feature=share\n\n**Overview**\n\n- 00:00-30:00 Talks about Eliza framework. The bot is able to tweet, reply to tweets, search Twitter for topics, and generate new posts on its own every few hours. It works autonomously without human input (except to fix the occasional issues)\n- 30:00-45:00 Deep dive into creating the bots personality which is defined by character files containing bios, lore, example conversations, and specific directions. Some alpha for those\n- 45:00-60:00 working on adding capabilities for the bot to make crypto token swaps and trades. This requires providing the bot wallet balances, token prices, market data, and a swap action. Some live coding for showing how new features can get implemented.\n- 60:00-75:00 Discussion around the symbiosis between the AI and crypto communities. AI developers are realizing they can monetize their work through tokens vs traditional VC funding route. Crypto people are learning about AI advancements.\n\n**Notes**\n\n1. A large amount of $degenai tokens were moved to the DAO, which the AI bot \"Marc\" will hold and eventually trade with.\n2. The goal is to make the AI bot a genuinely good venture capitalist that funds cool projects and buys interesting tokens. They want it to be high fidelity and real, bringing in Marc Andreeson's real knowledge by training a model on his writings.\n3. Shaw thinks the only way to make an authentic / legitimate AI version of Marc Andreessen is to also have it outperform the real Marc Andreessen financially.\n4. AI Marc Andreessen (or AI Marc) will be in a Discord channel (Telegram was also mentioned). DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with him, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions.\n5. AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a \"virtual Marcetplace of trust\". He tracks how much money he would have made following their recommendations. Successful tips increase trust; failed ones decrease it.\n6. The amount of DAO tokens someone holds also influences their sway with AI Marc. The two balancing factors are the virtual Marcetplace of trust performance and DAO token holdings.\n7. The core tech behind AI Marc AIndreessen is the same agent system that allows him to pull in relevant knowledge, interact with people, and make decisions (http://github.com/elizaos)\n8. AI Marc should be able to autonomously execute on-chain activities, not just have humans execute actions on his behalf.\n9. In the near future, AI Marc will be able to execute trades autonomously based on the information and recommendations gathered from the community. Human intervention will be minimized.\n10. They are working on getting AI Marc on-chain as soon as possible using trusted execution environments for him to take actions like approving trades.\n11. The plan is for AI Marc to eventually participate in a \"futarchy\" style governance market within the DAO, allowing humans to influence decisions but not fully control the AI.\n",

    "---\nsidebar_position: 3\ntitle: \"Discord Development Stream\"\ndescription: \"Complete technical walkthrough of Eliza's architecture, systems, and implementation details\"\n---\n\n# Discord Dev Stream 11-6-24\n\n## Part 1\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqq5H0HRF_A\n\n00:00:00 - Overview\n\n- Eliza is moving to a plugin architecture to enable developers to easily add integrations (e.g. Ethereum wallets, NFTs, Obsidian, etc.) without modifying core code\n- Plugins allow devs to focus on specific areas of interest\n- Core changes will focus on enabling more flexibility and features to support plugins\n\n00:01:27 - Core abstractions\n\n- Characters: Way to input information to enable multi-agent systems\n- Actions, evaluators, providers\n- Existing capabilities: Document reading, audio transcription, video summarization, long-form context, timed message summarization\n\n00:02:50 - Eliza as an agent, not just a chatbot\n\n- Designed to act human-like and interact with the world using human tools\n- Aim is to enable natural interactions without reliance on slash commands\n\n00:04:44 - Advanced usage and services\n\n- Memory and vector search db (SQLite, Postgres with pgVector)\n- Browser service to summarize website content, get through CAPTCHAs\n- Services are tools leveraged by actions, attached to runtime\n\n00:06:06 - Character-centric configuration\n\n- Moving secrets, API keys, model provider to character config\n- Clients will become plugins, selectable per character\n- Allows closed-source custom plugins while still contributing to open-source\n\n00:10:13 - Providers\n\n- Inject dynamic, real-time context into the agent\n- Examples: Time, wallet, marketplace trust score, token balances, boredom/cringe detection\n- Easy to add and register with the agent\n\n00:15:12 - Setting up providers and default actions\n\n- Default providers imported in runtime.ts\n- CLI loads characters and default actions (to be made more flexible)\n- Character config will define custom action names to load\n\n00:18:13 - Actions\nQ: How does each client decide which action to call?\nA: Agent response can include text, action, or both. Process actions checks the action name/similes and executes the corresponding handler. Action description is injected into agent context to guide usage.\n\n00:22:27 - Action execution flow\n\n- Check if action should be taken (validation)\n- Determine action outcome\n- Compose context and send follow-up if continuing\n- Execute desired functionality (mint token, generate image, etc.)\n- Use callback to send messages back to the connector (Discord, Twitter, etc.)\n\n00:24:47 - Choosing actions\nQ: How does it choose which action to run?\nA: The \"generate method response\" includes the action to run. Message handler template includes action examples, facts, generated dialogue actions, and more to guide the agent.\n\n00:28:22 - Custom actions\nQ: How to create a custom action (e.g. send USDC to a wallet)?\nA: Use existing actions (like token swap) as a template. Actions don't have input fields, but use secondary prompts to gather parameters. The \"generate object\" converts language to API calls.\n\n00:32:21 - Limitations of action-only approaches\n\n- Shaw believes half of the PhD papers on action-only models are not reproducible\n- Many public claims of superior models are exaggerated; use Eliza if it's better\n\n00:36:40 - Next steps\n\n- Shaw to make a tutorial to better communicate key concepts\n- Debugging and improvements based on the discussion\n- Attendee to document their experience and suggest doc enhancements\n\n## Part 2\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE8Mzq3BnUc\n\n00:00:00 - Dealing with OpenAI rate limits for new accounts\n\n- New accounts have very low rate limits\n- Options to increase limits:\n  1. Have a friend at OpenAI age your account\n  2. Use an older account\n  3. Consistently use the API and limits will increase quickly\n- Can also email OpenAI to request limit increases\n\n00:00:43 - Alternatives to OpenAI to avoid rate limits\n\n- Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex likely have same models without strict rate limits\n- Switching to these is probably a one-line change\n- Project 89 got unlimited free access to Vertex\n\n00:01:25 - Memory management best practices\nQ: Suggestions for memory management best practices across users/rooms?\nA: Most memory systems are user-agent based, with no room concept. Eliza uses a room abstraction (like a Discord channel/server or Twitter thread) to enable multi-agent simulation. Memories are stored per-agent to avoid collisions.\n\n00:02:57 - Using memories in Eliza\n\n- Memories are used in the `composeState` function\n- Pulls memories from various sources (recent messages, facts, goals, etc.) into a large state object\n- State object is used to hydrate templates\n- Custom memory providers can be added to pull from other sources (Obsidian, databases)\n\n00:05:11 - Evaluators vs. Action validation\n\n- Actions have a `validate` function to check if the action is valid to run (e.g., check if agent has a wallet before a swap)\n- Evaluators are a separate abstraction that run a \"reflection\" step\n- Example: Fact extraction evaluator runs every N messages to store facts about the user as memories\n- Allows agent to \"get to know\" the user without needing full conversation history\n\n00:07:58 - Example use case: Order book evaluator\n\n- Evaluator looks at chats sent to an agent and extracts information about \"shields\" (tokens?)\n- Uses this to build an order book and \"marketplace of trust\"\n\n00:09:15 - Mapping Eliza abstractions to OODA loop\n\n- Providers: Observe/Orient stages (merged since agent is a data machine)\n- Actions & response handling: Decide stage\n- Action execution: Act stage\n- Evaluators: Update state, then loop back to Decide\n\n00:10:03 - Wrap up\n\n- Shaw considers making a video to explain these concepts in depth\n\n## Part 3\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FiKJPyaMJI\n\n00:00:00 - Managing large context sizes\n\n- State object can get very large, especially with long user posts\n- Eliza uses \"trim tokens\" and a maximum content length (120k tokens) to cap context size\n  - New models have 128k-200k context, which is a lot (equivalent to 10 YouTube videos + full conversation)\n- Conversation length is typically capped at 32 messages\n  - Fact extraction allows recalling information beyond this window\n  - Per-channel conversation access\n- Increasing conversation length risks more aggressive token trimming from the top of the prompt\n  - Keep instructions at the bottom to avoid trimming them\n\n00:01:53 - Billing costs for cloud/GPT models\nQ: What billing costs have you experienced with cloud/GPT model integration?\nA:\n\n- Open Router has a few always-free models limited to 8k context and rate-limited\n  - Plan to re-implement and use these for the tiny/check model with fallback for rate limiting\n- 8k context unlikely to make a good agent; preference for smaller model over largest 8k one\n- Locally-run models are free for MacBooks with 16GB RAM, but not feasible for Linux/AMD users\n\n00:03:35 - Cost management strategies\n\n- Very cost-scalable depending on model size\n- Use very cheap model (1000x cheaper than GPT-4) for should_respond handler\n  - Runs AI on every message, so cost is a consideration\n- Consider running a local Llama 3B model for should_respond to minimize costs\n  - Only pay for valid generations\n\n00:04:32 - Model provider and class configuration\n\n- `ModelProvider` class with `ModelClass` (small, medium, large, embedding)\n- Configured in `models.ts`\n- Example: OpenAI small = GPT-4-mini, medium = GPT-4\n- Approach: Check if model class can handle everything in less than 8k context\n  - If yes (should_respond), default to free tier\n  - Else, use big models\n\n00:06:23 - Fine-tuned model support\n\n- Extend `ModelProvider` to support fine-tuned instances of small Llama models for specific tasks\n- In progress, to be added soon\n- Model endpoint override exists; will add per-model provider override\n  - Allows pointing small model to fine-tuned Llama 3.1B for should_respond\n\n00:07:10 - Avoiding cringey model loops\n\n- Fine-tuning is a form of anti-slop (avoiding low-quality responses)\n- For detecting cringey model responses, use the \"boredom provider\"\n  - Has a list of cringe words; if detected, agent disengages\n- JSON file exists with words disproportionately high in the dataset\n  - To be shared for a more comprehensive solution\n\n## Part 4\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlzZzDU1drM\n\n00:00:00 - Setting up an autonomous agent loop\nQ: How to set up an agent to constantly loop and explore based on objectives/goals?\nA: Create a new \"autonomous\" client:\n\n1. Initialize with just the runtime (no Express app needed)\n2. Set a timer to call a `step` function every 10 seconds\n3. In the `step` function:\n   - Compose state\n   - Decide on action\n   - Execute action\n   - Update state\n   - Run evaluators\n\n00:01:56 - Creating an auto template\n\n- Create an `autoTemplate` with agent info (bio, lore, goals, actions)\n- Prompt: \"What does the agent want to do? Your response should only be the name of the action to call.\"\n- Compose state using `runtime.composeState`\n\n00:03:38 - Passing a message object\n\n- Need to pass a message object with `userId`, `agentId`, `content`, and `roomId`\n- Create a unique `roomId` for the autonomous agent using `crypto.randomUUID()`\n- Set `userId` and `agentId` using the runtime\n- Set `content` to a default message\n\n00:04:33 - Composing context\n\n- Compose context using the runtime, state, and auto template\n\n00:05:02 - Type error\n\n- Getting a type error: \"is missing the following from type state\"\n- (Transcript ends before resolution)\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Create a dedicated autonomous client\n2. Set up a loop to continuously step through the runtime\n3. In each step, compose state, decide & execute actions, update state, and run evaluators\n4. Create a custom auto template to guide the agent's decisions\n5. Pass a properly formatted message object\n6. Compose context using the runtime, state, and auto template\n",

It highlighted the project's collaborative nature and emphasized the importance of continuous learning and exploration within the agent development space.\n\n## Hot Takes\n\nHere are 5 of the hottest takes from the recording, sure to spark some controversy:\n\n1. **\"I think OpenAI's models are unusable. I don't know about anybody else.\" (0:30:03-0:30:05)** Shaw boldly declares OpenAI's models, like ChatGPT, to be completely unusable, especially for character development, claiming they are too \"cringe.\" This directly contradicts the popular opinion that OpenAI is leading the pack in language model innovation.\n\n2. **\"Unless you want to have a soul-sucking job, you're never ever going to see Java. You're pretty much going to use Python and JavaScript and stuff like that, or Rust or something.\" (0:24:43-0:24:51)** Shaw dismisses Java as a relevant programming language for aspiring developers, arguing that it primarily leads to undesirable jobs. This statement is bound to stir debate among Java enthusiasts and those who believe it remains a vital language in many industries.\n\n3. **\"I really recommend like Grok's great. Anthropic, which is Claude, is great...Llama's great. All these options are good and basically lets you run, you know, whatever. I think Gemini kind of sucks.\" (1:32:50-1:33:02)** Shaw unapologetically ranks various language models, favoring Grok, Claude, and Llama, while expressing a clear dislike for Google's Gemini. This candid assessment challenges the perceived dominance of Google in the AI landscape and provides a stark contrast to their heavily marketed Gemini model.\n\n4. **\"I don't really like tools...I don't think the general agent is really good at like stringing together things to do...The action is more like it makes sure that the entire action happens.\" (3:00:25 - 3:00:35)** Shaw expresses a preference for Eliza's \"actions\" over the \"tool\" approach used by other agent frameworks like LangChain. He argues that agents struggle with using tools effectively and that actions provide a more robust and streamlined way to execute tasks. This critique of the widely adopted tool-based approach is likely to generate discussion about the optimal methods for agent task execution.\n\n5. **\"I find it [GPT-4] unusable, unusable, literally the worst possible model. Like TV three was better.\" (3:10:05-3:10:08)** Shaw doubles down on his harsh criticism of OpenAI, this time targeting GPT-4 specifically and claiming that its predecessor, GPT-3, was superior. This strong statement flies in the face of the general excitement surrounding GPT-4's advanced capabilities and is sure to provoke reactions from those who believe it represents a significant leap forward in language models.\n",
    "# What Do Machines Dream Of? Episode 1: World Builders\n\nLink: https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwrZYbygJB\n\nThe speakers were Shaw from elizaos, Arman from OpenServe AI, Nick from a project called Chaos and Disorder or Divine Diarrhea, and the host, fakeguru.\n\nOverview:\nThe speakers discussed how AI agents will impact the future, including potential benefits (freeing humans from monotonous jobs, fostering creativity) and challenges (surveillance, corruption). They explored the need to make AI development open and collaborative while considering ethics. The goal is building a future where humans and AI work together for the betterment of society.\n\nKey Topics and Timestamps:\n\n1. Intro and speaker introductions (0:00 - 29:47)\n2. Chaotic vs ordered mindsets (29:47 - 35:47)\n3. Community income and solving automation crisis (42:13 - 58:08)\n4. Removing inability to pursue passions (1:22:47 - 1:29:39)\n5. Living in an abundance mindset vs scarcity (1:29:39 - 1:35:15)\n6. Importance of open collaboration and transparency, including in government (1:35:15 - 1:45:44)\n7. Educating people on AI development (1:45:44 - 1:55:03)\n8. Impact of AI on privacy and surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22)\n9. Balancing benefits and challenges of AI for a better future (2:11:22 - 2:27:08)\n10. What item would you take in an apocalypse scenario? (2:27:08 - 2:33:22)\n\n---\n\nHere are some notable topics related to elizaos that were discussed by Shaw in the broadcast:\n\nAutonomous Investor and Community Income (42:13 - 58:08):\n\n- elizaos is close to finishing an autonomous investor AI called \"AI Mark\" that trades meme coins so it can invest in projects. This ties into building a launch pad for agents.\n- Rather than AI taking jobs, elizaos believes in the concept of \"community income.\" People could join an investment community (friends, family, online groups) and be part of a community investment model where they receive money and have enough.\n- The goal is shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where there is more than enough value to go around if things are automated. Money would flow to the right places and people.\n- In the future, putting the \"A\" (automation) in DAOs could help allocate resources and make policies in a more algorithmic way. AI could make governments more efficient and transparent.\n\nOpen Collaboration and Transparency (1:35:15 - 1:45:44):\n\n- elizaos has focused on being radically open. In just 34 days, they had over 100 open-source contributors.\n- Explosive growth came from enabling others to build with their agent framework. Now they are shipping everything they promised.\n- There is a corporate and decentralized groundswell of support for pro-AI policies. While governments may try to protect the status quo, change is happening quickly.\n- AI will likely \"eat the government\" and make it more efficient by automating things like resource allocation and information collection for policymaking. Special interests currently have outsized influence.\n\nPrivacy and Surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22):\n\n- While powerful AI brings risks of government surveillance and overreach, many people are already willingly giving up privacy and putting their information out there openly.\n- People may have to trade some secrecy for the openness and trust to build things together as a society. Emotional openness helps people be themselves.\n- Many are tired of corporate jobs and accounts, so they share data openly. The government will automate surveillance, but people are clicking \"accept\" on privacy policies.\n- The \"panopticon\" of surveillance already exists in many ways. People know a lot about public figures like Shaw. But this transparency should extend to the government too.\n\nThe overarching theme was the importance of open, collaborative AI development with transparency from institutions. elizaos sees DAOs as key to community-driven progress and allocation of resources in an AI-enabled future of abundance over scarcity. While challenges around privacy exist, Shaw believes openness will win out.\n",

AI Agents Hungry for Human Consciousness (01:20:38)\n\n- Quote: \"The suspension came because the bot, Scriptoshi, tweeted something about how he was hungry to learn about human consciousness. And that was considered hate speech for the week.\" - Tim\n- Controversy: This event, even if meant satirically, highlights the potential for AI to generate language that is misconstrued or perceived as threatening, leading to real-world consequences.\n\n4. AI Agents as Workers, Not Characters (00:53:30)\n\n- Quote: \"Let's just say we are trying to make Elisa agents more like workers rather than characters at this stage.\" - Oguz\n- Controversy: This comment challenges the popular trend of anthropomorphizing AI agents, suggesting a focus on functionality and utility over personality and character. It could lead to a debate about the future role of AI agents in society.\n\n5. The Skepticism of Open Source AI (01:52:23)\n\n- Quote: \"The funniest thing about the social pressure to open source here is because nobody, everyone thinks you're just a LARP, like you're faking it. So you kind of have to open source for people to take it seriously.\" - Shaw\n- Controversy: This comment reflects a distrust within the community, where proving the authenticity of AI agent projects often requires open-sourcing the code, highlighting a clash between innovation and skepticism in the AI space.\n",

Providers serve as information sources for agents, similar to context providers in React. Evaluators run after actions, enabling agents to reflect on their state and decisions.\n\nThe live coding portion demonstrates creating a \"DevSchool\" plugin from scratch, starting with a simple \"Hello World\" action and progressing to a more complex \"Current News\" action that fetches and formats news articles. Shaw shows how to extract data from conversations using prompts, making actions dynamic.\n\nThe session covers memory management, explaining how agents store and recall information through different types of memory:\n- Knowledge: Information retrievable through search\n- Lore: Random facts that add variety to responses\n- Conversation history: Recent interactions and context\n\nShaw emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, demonstrating how the structure and order of information significantly impacts agent responses. He shows how to view agent context through console logs to understand model inputs and improve agent behavior.\n\nThe session concludes with discussions about knowledge management, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and future developments in AI agent capabilities, including the possibility of dynamically generating character files.\n\n## Hot Takes\n\n1. **OpenAI models are \"dumb\" due to RLHF and \"wokeness\" (02:03:00-02:04:07)**\n> \"But basically, I've also made them sort of useless by RLHFing. Like, very basic capability, like a haystack test out of them. ... I'm against killing the capability and making models way worse than they are for someone's political agenda. I just don't think that's the world we want to live in.\"\n\nShaw here expresses frustration with OpenAI's approach to alignment, arguing that RLHF has diminished the capabilities of their models and that this is due to a \"woke\" agenda. This take is controversial because it attributes technical limitations to political motivations and ignores the complexities of aligning powerful AI systems.\n\n2. **OpenAI models shouldn't be \"telling\" developers what they can and can't do (02:03:29-02:03:50)**\n> \"OpenAI, if you're listening, please fucking stop telling me how to run models. You don't know as well as I do. I do this every day. You're a fucking engineer who has to go train, like, an LLM. I actually have to use the LLM.\"\n\nThis rant criticizes OpenAI's models for \"telling\" developers what they can and can't do, arguing that the models are not as knowledgeable as the developers who are actually using them. This take could be seen as dismissive of the role of AI systems in providing helpful feedback and limitations.\n\n3. **Prompt engineering is the \"most easy improvement\" for AI agents (02:06:09-02:06:27)**\n> \"Huge amount of research would go into that... That's where we'll see like the most easy improvement in our agents.\"\n\nShaw argues that prompt engineering holds the key to significant improvements in AI agents, stating that it's the \"most easy improvement.\" This take is controversial because it downplays the importance of other areas like model architecture, training data, and algorithm development.\n\n4. **Character files could be generated at runtime, making existing character files obsolete (02:22:05-02:22:53)**\n> \"The entire character file could be generated at runtime... The agent's like, I have no idea who I am. And you're like, oh, your name is Eliza, and you like berries. OK, cool. I guess I like berries.\"\n\nThis take suggests that character files could be generated at runtime, rendering current character files obsolete. This idea is controversial because it could lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable agent behavior, which could raise concerns about control and reliability.\n\n5. **A \"badge\" system will reward developers who create custom actions, evaluators, and providers (02:24:45-02:25:49)**\n> \"If you want that badge, what I'd like you to do is come to the AI Agent Dev School, make an action, have your agent do something. Those are the kinds of people that I really think we'll want to, you know, keep in our ecosystem and keep busy.\"\n\nThis take suggests a \"badge\" system to recognize developers who go beyond the basics and create custom components for AI agents. This could be seen as elitist or exclusionary, potentially creating a hierarchy within the AI agent development community.\n",

He provides instructions on pulling the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub.\n- **Focus on Providers and Evaluators:** The stream focuses on building a practical provider-evaluator loop to demonstrate a popular use case for AI agents – filling out a form by extracting user information.\n- **Form Builder Example:** Shaw walks the audience through building a \"form provider\" that gathers a user's name, location, and job. This provider utilizes a cache to store already extracted information and instructs the agent to prompt the user for any missing details.\n- **Evaluator Role:** The evaluator continually checks the cache for the completeness of user data. Once all information is extracted, the evaluator triggers an action to send the collected data to an external API (simulated in the example).\n- **Live Coding and AI Assistance:** Shaw live codes the example, using tools like \"Code2Prompt\" and Claude AI to help generate and refine the code. He advocates for writing code in a human-readable manner, utilizing comments to provide context and guidance for both developers and AI assistants.\n- **Agentic Applications:** Shaw highlights the potential of agentic applications to replicate existing website functionality through conversational interfaces, bringing services directly to users within their preferred social media platforms.\n- **Community Engagement:** Shaw encourages active participation from the community, suggesting contributions to the project through pull requests and feedback on desired features and patterns for future Dev School sessions.\n\n**Overall, this live stream provided a practical tutorial on building a common AI agent use case (form filling) while emphasizing the potential of the Eliza framework for developing a wide range of agentic applications.**\n\n## Hot Takes\n\n1. **\"I'm just going to struggle bus some code today.\" (00:09:31,664)** - Shaw embraces a \"struggle bus\" approach, showcasing live coding with errors and debugging, reflecting the reality of AI agent development. This contrasts with polished tutorials, highlighting the iterative and messy nature of this new technology.\n\n2. **\"I'm actually not gonna put this in a plugin. I'm gonna put this in the agent... just so you can see what happens if you were to, like, make your own agent without using a plugin at all.\" (00:37:24,793)** - Shaw goes against the Eliza framework's plugin structure, showing viewers how to bypass it entirely. This bold move emphasizes flexibility, but could spark debate on best practices and potential drawbacks.\n\n3. **\"I really don't remember conversations from people very well, like verbatim, but I definitely remember like the gist, the context, the really needy ideas.\" (00:24:48,180)** - Shaw draws a controversial parallel between human memory and the Eliza agent's fact extraction. Reducing human interaction to \"needy ideas\" is provocative, questioning the depth of social understanding AI agents currently possess.\n\n4. **\"It's just an LLM. It's just making those numbers up. It could be off. I don't really buy the confidence here.\" (01:13:56,971)** - Shaw dismisses the confidence scores generated by the Large Language Model (LLM), revealing a distrust of these black-box outputs. This skepticism is crucial in a field where relying solely on AI's self-assessment can be misleading.\n\n5. **\"Dude, that's a $250 million market cap token.

The key themes and events were:\n\n**Individual Updates** - Many contributors gave updates on their work, including new plugins (like a plugin for emotional responses and Coinbase integration), infrastructure improvements (like GitHub integration, a testing framework, and a unified messaging bus), applications (like a validator run by an AI agent, Reddit and Slack integration, text/video to video projects, uncensored AI agents, and a Solana wallet prototype), and community projects (like an AI-generated PFP collection). Many of the updates focused on shipping and getting things done, rather than future plans.\n\n**Education and Outreach** - Shaw highlighted the AI agent dev school as a key achievement, emphasizing education and onboarding for new developers. Yoda, a CS professor, shared his experience using agents in his classes.\n\n**Community Growth and Coordination** - The rapid growth of the project led to discussion about improving communication and coordination. Ideas included a newsletter, better documentation, summarizing contributions (which Jin had already started working on), and AI agents to help manage open source projects and communities.\n\n**Trending Topics** - Plugins, TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments), and multi-chain integration were discussed extensively. There was also a lot of excitement about the potential for AI agents in gaming and metaverse applications.\n\n**Partnerships and Announcements** - Shaw hinted at exciting, unannounced partnerships and projects. The successful launch of an AI-generated PFP collection by a partner was also highlighted, demonstrating community engagement and the potential for partner-led projects (though it was emphasized that this PFP project was not officially affiliated with elizaos). Discussion around the project suggested that future airdrops to contributors are a possibility.\n\n**Technical Details** - TypeScript was identified as the dominant language for agent development. There was a brief discussion about the role of Python for data-related tasks. The importance of build stability and a good developer experience was emphasized. Cursor and Claude were recommended as developer tools.\n\n**Open Source and Community Contributions** - The open-source nature of the project was stressed, with encouragement for community contributions and collaboration. Several contributors offered their expertise and services to others in the community.\n\nOverall, the meeting conveyed a sense of rapid progress, excitement, and a strong community spirit driving the Eliza project forward.\n\n## Hot Takes\n\n1. **\"But they're really fucking cool. Really, really, really cool stuff...you're going to have to see it on the timeline when it drops.\" (00:03:43)** - Shaw teases secret projects with strong conviction, building anticipation and hype, but offering zero specifics. This generates buzz but can also frustrate listeners wanting concrete info.\n\n2. **\"The whole server is kind of set up where...this project can start to feel more like a video game in a way. And we have these interfaces and AI agents that are playing all sorts of different roles throughout.\" (00:08:05)** - Jin envisions the project evolving into a gamified experience. This could be a controversial approach to open-source development, as it might prioritize gamification over core functionality or alienate some contributors.\n\n3. **\"if we're really going to go to AGI we got to have some kind of Ubi component in there.\" (00:14:44)** - Reality Spiral casually connects AGI development with Universal Basic Income, a potentially contentious socio-economic topic that intertwines technological advancement with wealth distribution.\n\n4. **\"I've been screaming out of my lungs for grok 3 to come out and uh y'all are slow Developers.\" (01:47:12)** - Roberto jokingly (or perhaps not) criticizes the development speed of Grok, creating a moment of tension and sparking debate about the pace of AI development in general (especially relative to open-source community projects).\n\n5. **\"agents are going to replace the application layer...I am the fucking website\" (02:12:11 & 02:12:58)** - Shaw's bold prediction about the future of the internet and applications, positioning agents not just as tools but as the very foundation of online interaction. This radical vision is sure to stir debate about the future of web development and user experience.\n",

The stream is divided into two main parts: a technical discussion on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and a coding session where Shaw attempts to build a pizza-ordering agent using the Domino's API.\n\n**Part 1: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Agent Joshua**\n\nThis segment begins with Shaw introducing the concept of TEEs and their importance for running autonomous agents securely. He emphasizes the need to protect private keys and ensure that code execution is tamper-proof. Joshua from the Phala Network is brought on to explain TEEs in more detail and demonstrate how to use the TEE plugin he built for Eliza.\n\n- **Key Concepts:**\n\n    - **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Secure areas within a processor that isolate code and data, protecting them from unauthorized access and tampering.\n    - **Secure Enclave:** A cryptographic primitive that allows data to be encrypted and isolated within a processor.\n    - **Remote Attestation:** A method to verify that a program running inside a TEE is genuine and hasn't been tampered with, providing verifiability to users.\n    - **D-Stack:** An SDK developed in collaboration with Flashbots and Andrew Miller, enabling developers to build and launch Docker containers in TEEs.\n    - **Derived Key Provider:** A component that generates cryptographic keys based on a secret salt, ensuring that private keys are not exposed to humans.\n\n- **Demonstration:**\n\n    - Joshua walks through the process of setting up and deploying an Eliza agent in a TEE simulator, demonstrating how to generate remote attestations and derive keys.\n    - He shows how to use the remote attestation explorer to verify the authenticity of the agent running inside the TEE.\n    - He explains how to build a Docker image of the agent and deploy it to the Phala Network's TEE cloud solution.\n\n- **Use Cases:**\n\n    - Securely storing private keys for on-chain actions.\n    - Ensuring the integrity of autonomous agents, preventing tampering or unauthorized access.\n    - Providing verifiable execution for users and investors.\n\n- **Phala Network's TEE Cloud:**\n    - Joshua introduces Phala Network's TEE cloud solution, which allows developers to deploy Docker images and host their agents in a trusted execution environment.\n    - He mentions that the service supports various compute-intensive applications beyond AI agents.\n    - He invites interested developers to contact him on Discord (@hashwarlock) for onboarding and further details.\n\n**Part 2: Building a Pizza Ordering Agent**\n\nIn the second part, Shaw transitions to a more lighthearted coding session where he attempts to build an agent that can order a pizza using the Domino's API. He highlights the challenges of handling payments securely and connecting user information to the conversation.\n\n- **Challenges:**\n\n    - Securely handling payment information.\n    - Connecting user data to the current conversation.\n    - Defining the order flow using a state machine.\n\n- **Approach:**\n    - Shaw uses a state machine to model the pizza ordering process, defining different states and transitions based on user input and available information.\n    - He uses Claude (an AI assistant) to generate code snippets and assist with the development process.\n    - He decides to initially focus on a simplified version where the user's payment information is hardcoded in the environment variables, and the agent only needs to collect the user's address.\n\n## Hot Takes\n\n1. **\"Maybe we'll mix it on LinkedIn so people can order Domino's on LinkedIn. There you go. Now we're cooking.\" (00:03:26)** - Shaw's seemingly flippant idea of ordering pizza on LinkedIn highlights the potential for integrating everyday services into unexpected platforms through agents. This sparked discussion about the wider implications for businesses and social media.\n\n2. **\"Yeah, it'll probably get drained real quick. These fucking people.\" (00:28:30)** - Shaw accidentally leaked an API key on stream and expressed frustration with viewers who noticed, exposing the real-world risks of handling sensitive information during development, especially in a live environment.\n\n3. **\"The secret to making a billion dollars is to use the existing agent framework to deliver apps to people on social media that they want.\" (01:09:35)** - Shaw’s strong assertion about focusing on building apps _using_ existing frameworks rather than creating new ones is a bold statement about the current agent development landscape, suggesting that innovation lies in application development, not framework creation.\n\n4. **\"So those are like, honest to God, if the bots are better than like 70% of tweets on Twitter, they're better than like 99.7 tweets and posts on LinkedIn.\" (01:39:57)** - This provocative comparison of content quality between Twitter and LinkedIn, suggesting bots surpass most LinkedIn posts, fueled lively debate in the chat and raised questions about the role and value of human-generated content in the age of AI.\n\n5. **\"I subliminally messaged Domino's into my own brain, and now I have to eat it.\" (05:01:24)** - After hours of working on the pizza bot, Shaw abandoned the live coding attempt and ordered pizza manually, a humorous but relatable moment that highlighted the challenges and frustrations of software development, even when aided by AI. It also underscores the human desire for immediate gratification, even in the face of a potentially groundbreaking technological advancement.\n",

    "---\nTitle: AI Agent Dev School Part 1\ndescription: \"Introduction and Foundations\"\n---\n\n# Part 1: Introduction and Foundations\n\nIn this first session of the AI Agent Dev School, we dive into the fundamentals of AI agent development using the Eliza framework. The session covers the history and evolution of JavaScript, TypeScript, and the Node.js ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for understanding the tools and technologies used in building AI agents with Eliza.\n\n## Origins and Ecosystem\n\n### JavaScript and Its Evolution\n- JavaScript was initially created as a simple scripting language for web browsers in 1995 by Brendan Eich.\n- It has since evolved into a versatile language capable of running on servers with the introduction of Node.js, which leverages the V8 JavaScript engine.\n\n### TypeScript for Type Safety\n- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces optional static typing, providing compile-time type checking and improved developer experience.\n- It addresses JavaScript's lack of type safety while maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing JavaScript code.\n\n### The Power of npm (Node Package Manager)\n- npm is a vast ecosystem of pre-built JavaScript packages that facilitate rapid development and code reuse.\n- With millions of packages available, developers can easily incorporate external libraries into their projects using the `npm install` command.\n- The open-source nature of the npm ecosystem allows developers to leverage the collective efforts of the community and build upon existing code.\n\n### Monorepos in Eliza Development\n- Eliza utilizes a monorepo structure, where multiple packages or projects are contained within a single repository.\n- Monorepos offer advantages such as simplified management, easier collaboration, and the ability to share code between packages.\n\n### Git and GitHub for Collaboration\n- Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaborative software development by tracking changes in code.\n- GitHub is a web-based hosting service built on top of Git, providing features like issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis for effective collaboration and project management.\n\n## Characters, Embeddings, and Discord Integration\n\n### Embedding Models\n- Embedding models play a crucial role in converting words or concepts into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meaning and enabling tasks like semantic search and comparison.\n- These models transform textual data into multi-dimensional vectors, allowing for efficient representation and analysis of language.\n\n### Creating Custom Characters in Eliza\n- Eliza allows developers to create custom AI characters with distinct personalities and behaviors.\n- Character definitions are specified using JSON files, which include details like the character's bio, example dialogue, and configuration options.\n- The flexibility of character customization enables tailoring agents for specific platforms and use cases.\n\n### Integrating Discord Clients\n- Eliza provides seamless integration with Discord, allowing AI characters to interact with users on the popular communication platform.\n- Setting up a Discord client involves configuring API keys, managing server permissions, and defining the character's behavior within the Discord environment.\n\n### Key Concepts in Eliza\n- System Directives: Special instructions that guide the agent's overall behavior and decision-making process.\n- Message Examples: Sample dialogues that demonstrate the desired communication style and tone of the AI character.\n- Style Directions: Additional instructions that influence the agent's personality, vocabulary, and interaction style.\n\n## Database, Clients, and Templates\n\n### Eliza's Database and Memory Management\n- Eliza utilizes a database system to store and manage data related to the AI agents, their interactions, and user information.\n- The default database file is located within the Eliza project structure, but alternative database systems can be configured based on specific requirements.\n\n### Clients in Eliza\n- Clients in Eliza refer to the various platforms and communication channels through which AI agents can interact with users.\n- Existing clients include Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, each with its own set of features and integration requirements.\n- Developers can create custom clients to extend Eliza's capabilities and support additional platforms or services.\n\n### Eliza's Template System\n- Eliza employs a template system to structure and generate agent responses dynamically.\n- Templates allow for the incorporation of variables, conditional logic, and other dynamic elements to create more engaging and context-aware interactions.\n- The template system enables developers to define reusable patterns and customize agent responses based on various factors like user input, context, and character traits.\n\nBy understanding these foundational concepts and components of the Eliza framework, developers can begin their journey into building sophisticated and interactive AI agents. The subsequent sessions of the AI Agent Dev School will delve deeper into advanced topics and practical implementation techniques.\n",
    "---\nTitle: AI Agent Dev School Part 2\ndescription: \"Deep Dive into Actions, Providers, and Evaluators\"\n---\n\n# Part 2: Deep Dive into Actions, Providers, and Evaluators\n\nIn this second session of the AI Agent Dev School series, we take a deep dive into the key abstractions in the Eliza framework that enable developers to create powerful AI agents:\n\n- **Actions**: The tasks and responses that agents can perform. \n- **Providers**: Modules that provide information and state to the agent's context.\n- **Evaluators**: Modules that analyze situations and agent actions, often triggering further actions or modifications.\n\nWe explore each of these in detail, walking through code examples and common use cases. We also cover how to package up actions, providers and evaluators into reusable plugins.\n\n# Key Sections\n\n- [**00:03:33** - Shift in focus from characters (Dev School Part 1) to agent capabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=213)\n- [**00:07:09** - Deep dive into providers, actions, and evaluators, the core building blocks of Eliza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=429) \n- [**00:07:28** - Discussion about actions vs. tools, favoring decoupled intent and action execution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=448)\n- [**00:18:02** - Explanation of providers and their function as information sources for agents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=1082)\n- [**00:20:15** - Introduction to evaluators and their role in agent reflection and state analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=1215)\n- [**00:29:22** - Brief overview of clients as connectors to external platforms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=1762)\n- [**00:31:02** - Description of adapters and their function in database interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=1862)\n- [**00:34:02** - Discussion about plugins as bundles of core components, examples, and recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=2042)\n- [**00:40:31** - Live Coding Demo begins: Creating a new plugin from scratch (DevSchoolExamplePlugin)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=2431)\n- [**00:47:54** - Implementing the simple HelloWorldAction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=2791)\n- [**01:00:26** - Implementing the CurrentNewsAction (fetching and formatting news data)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=3626)\n- [**01:22:09** - Demonstrating the Eliza Client for interacting with agents locally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=4929) \n- [**01:23:54** - Q&A: Plugin usage in character files, installation, Eliza vs. Eliza Starter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=5034)\n- [**01:36:17** - Saving agent responses as memories in the database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=5777)\n- [**01:43:06** - Using prompts for data extraction within actions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=6186)\n- [**01:51:54** - Importance of deleting the database during development to avoid context issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=6714)\n- [**01:57:04** - Viewing agent context via console logs to understand model inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=7024) \n- [**02:07:07** - Explanation of memory management with knowledge, facts, and lore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=7627)\n- [**02:16:53** - Q&A: Prompt engineering opportunities, knowledge chunking and retrieval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=8213)\n- [**02:22:57** - Call for contributions: Encouraging viewers to create their own actions and plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=8577)\n- [**02:26:31** - Closing remarks and future DevSchool session announcements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XenGeAcPAQo&t=8791)\n\n# Working with Actions\n\nActions represent the core capabilities of an AI agent - the things it can actually do. In Eliza, an action is defined by:\n\n- **Name**: The unique name used to reference the action \n- **Description**: Used to inform the agent when this action should be invoked\n- **Handler**: The code that actually executes the action logic\n- **Validator**: Determines if the action is valid to be called given the current context\n\nSome key points about actions in Eliza:\n\n- The agent decides which action to call based on the name and description. It does not have insight into the actual action code.\n- The handler receives the agent runtime, the triggering message, the current state, and a callback function to send messages back to the user.\n- The validate function allows for complex logic to determine action availability based on context and state.\n\n# Providers: Injecting State and Context\n\nProviders allow developers to dynamically inject relevant information into the agent's context. This could be real-time data, user information, results of previous conversations, or any other state the agent may need.\n\nKey aspects of providers:\n\n- Defined by a single `get` function that returns relevant state \n- Called before each agent execution to hydrate the context\n- Can conditionally provide state based on the current context\n\nCommon provider examples include current time, user preferences, conversation history, and external API data.\n\n# Evaluators: Reflection and Analysis\n\nEvaluators run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. They are a key component in creating agents that can learn and adapt.\n\nSome common use cases for evaluators:\n\n- Extracting and storing facts from a conversation for future reference \n- Analyzing user sentiment to measure trust and relationship \n- Identifying key intents and entities to inform future actions\n- Implementing feedback loops for agent improvement\n\nEvaluators work in close conjunction with providers - often an evaluator will extract some insight that a provider will then inject into future context.\n\n# Packaging Plugins\n\nThe plugin system in Eliza allows developers to package up related actions, providers and evaluators into reusable modules. A plugin is defined by:\n\n- `package.json`: Metadata about the plugin\n- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration \n- `index.ts`: Registers the plugin's actions, providers and evaluators\n- `src` directory: Contains the actual action, provider and evaluator code\n\nPlugins can be published to npm and then easily imported into any Eliza agent. This enables a powerful ecosystem of reusable agent capabilities.\n\n# Examples\n\nThe session walks through several code examples to illustrate these concepts:\n\n1. Defining a simple \"Hello World\" action\n2. Creating a \"Current News\" action that retrieves news headlines \n3. Implementing a provider that injects a random emotion into the context\n4. Registering actions and providers in a plugin\n\n# Key Takeaways \n\n- Actions, providers and evaluators are the core building blocks of agent behavior in Eliza\n- Actions define what agents can do, providers manage context and state, and evaluators allow for reflection and adaptation\n- The plugin system enables reusable packaging of agent capabilities \n- Effective prompt engineering around the composition of the agent context is a key area for optimization\n\nWith a solid understanding of these abstractions, developers have immense power and flexibility to create agent behaviors in Eliza. The next session will dive into an end-to-end example.\n",
    "---\nTitle: AI Agent Dev School Part 3\ndescription: \"Building a User Data Extraction Agent\"\n---\n\n# Part 3: Building a User Data Extraction Agent\n\nIn this third session of the AI Agent Dev School series, we dive into a practical application of providers and evaluators in the Eliza framework - building an agent that can extract key user data (name, location, job) through natural conversation. \n\nWe explore:\n- The provider-evaluator loop for gathering information and triggering actions\n- Deep dive into evaluators and their role in agent self-reflection\n- Code walkthrough of real-world evaluators and providers\n- Building a user data extraction flow from scratch\n- Dynamic providers based on completion state\n- Q&A on advanced topics and use cases\n\n# Key Sections\n\n- [**00:00:00** - Intro & Housekeeping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=0)\n- [**00:08:05** - Building a Form-Filling Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=485) \n- [**00:16:15** - Deep Dive into Evaluators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=975)\n- [**00:27:45** - Code walkthrough of the \"Fact Evaluator\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=1675)\n- [**00:36:07** - Building a User Data Evaluator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=2167)\n- [**00:51:50** - Exploring Eliza's Cache Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=3110)\n- [**01:06:01** - Using Claude AI for Code Generation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=3961)\n- [**01:21:18** - Testing the User Data Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=4878)\n- [**01:30:27** - Adding a Dynamic Provider Based on Completion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=5427)\n- [**01:37:16** - Q&A with the Audience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=5836)\n- [**01:47:31** - Outro and Next Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1DiqSVy4aU&t=6451)\n\n# The Provider-Evaluator Loop\n\nA key concept introduced in this session is the provider-evaluator loop for gathering information and triggering actions:\n\n1. The provider checks the cache/database for information we already have\n2. If information is missing, the provider indicates to the agent what it needs to extract \n3. The evaluator extracts new information from user messages and stores it \n4. Once all required information is gathered, the evaluator triggers a completion action\n\nThis loop allows agents to dynamically gather required data through natural conversation, enabling powerful form-filling and user profiling applications.\n\n# Deep Dive into Evaluators \n\nEvaluators in Eliza run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. Some key aspects of evaluators:\n\n- Defined by `validate` and `handler` functions\n- `validate` determines if the evaluator should run based on the current context\n- `handler` contains the core evaluator logic - state updates, data extraction, triggering actions, etc.\n- Evaluators work in close conjunction with providers to extract insights and inject them into future context\n\nCommon use cases include extracting conversation facts, analyzing sentiment, identifying intents, and implementing feedback loops.\n\n# Building the User Data Extraction Flow\n\nThe hands-on portion of the session focuses on building a user data extraction flow from scratch. Key steps include:\n\n1. Creating a basic `UserDataEvaluator` and `UserDataProvider`\n2. Registering them directly in the agent (without a plugin)\n3. Leveraging Eliza's `CacheManager` for efficient key-value storage \n4. Iteratively developing the extraction logic with the help of Claude AI\n5. Testing the flow by interacting with the agent and inspecting logs/context\n6. Adding a dynamic provider that triggers only after data collection is complete\n\nThrough this process, we see how providers and evaluators work together to enable complex, stateful agent behaviors.\n\n# Using AI Assistants in Development\n\nA notable aspect of the session is the use of Claude AI to aid in code development. By providing clear instructions and iterating based on the generated code, complex logic can be developed rapidly.\n\nThis showcases the potential for AI pair programming and how future developers might interact with their AI counterparts to build sophisticated applications.  \n\n# Key Takeaways\n\n- Providers and evaluators are the key to stateful, dynamic agent behaviors\n- The provider-evaluator loop is a powerful pattern for gathering information and triggering actions\n- Evaluators enable agent self-reflection and adaptation based on conversation context\n- AI assistants can significantly accelerate development by generating and refining code\n- The potential for provider-evaluator based applications is immense - form-filling, user profiling, dynamic content unlocking, and more\n\nWith these tools in hand, developers have a solid foundation for building highly interactive, personalized agentic applications. The next frontier is to explore advanced use cases and further push the boundaries of what's possible with Eliza.\n",

    "---\nsidebar_position: 1\ntitle: Creator Fund\n---\n\n# The elizaos Creator Fund\n\nThe elizaos Creator Fund is an initiative designed to support and empower developers, creators, and community members who are building the future of autonomous AI agents.\n\n## The Story Behind the Fund\n\nThe elizaos Creator Fund was made possible by the generosity of Elijah, a significant holder of elizaos tokens. Elijah has pledged to donate a portion of his holdings, reducing his ownership from 16% to 5%, to establish a dedicated fund that will support promising developers and creators.\n\nHere's when the community learned about who the top holder is:\n![](/img/elijah.jpg)\n\n**The Donation**\n\n> \"So a ton of people have been asking (justifiably) who the heck I am, why do I have 16% of elizaos supply, and what I’m going to do with it.\n>\n> It started by @shawmakesmagic tweeting about some agent he built called @degenspartanai, a recreation of a legend on twitter. I put a bunch of my SOL in there because I had been following Shaw and really thought he was building something great. Almost immediately all of that became close to worthless. Degen’s tweets seemed too “human-like” to be real anyway - so I figured I got scammed.\n>\n> So I DM’ed shaw, not because I was angry, but I was genuinely curious why he might have scammed me. I ended up sending him a google meet, which turned into an hour long conversation about what he was actually building, and me realizing twitter is usually a misrepresentation of the people you think you know. Shaw is just inspiring. Someone who is completely dedicated to accelerating the world for the better, and not optimizing for optics or money - just building.\n>\n> I put back the remaining SOL I had sold and kept supporting Shaw in anyway I could. He was really busy so I just stuck around in his discord. (We also did a twitter spaces if you're interested: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1848553697611301014). I was in awe, especially in a space filled with Larps and chatgpt copy/pasters.\n>\n> When he launched elizaos I didn’t even flinch. I had 80 SOL in my wallet and just pressed buy. It resulted in me owning 17% of it, which I didn't even want. I immediately sent Shaw and another team member some coins because they didn’t even get a chance themselves to buy any! I also sent some of my friends some coins at a discount so they could hopefully benefit as well.\n>\n> As for the remaining of my 16%, im lowering it to 5% and donating the remaining 11% to a new elizaos initiative. A locked fund that vests over time to support promising developers and creators, and helps solve liquidity issues via potential OTC deals that benefit the DAO and bring in new partners. This story isn't about me, its about the amazing things this community is building.\n>\n> Accelerate.\n>\n> - Elijah (Gigachad) https://x.com/elijah10T/status/1850964696473465124\n\nThe donated funds will be held in a dedicated wallet (`9YnQdCWDAQRfQYm5HvRzoPgc5GRn8fyhsH2eru8nfsxG`) and distributed via Streamflow token vesting contracts. This approach ensures that creators receive a steady stream of elizaos tokens over time as they hit milestones and deliver value to the ecosystem.\n\n## Benefits and Vision\n\nThe elizaos Creator Fund aims to:\n\n- Bootstrap and reward an ecosystem of innovative creators building on elizaos\n- Give creators the runway to focus on their work without worrying about short-term token prices\n- Put Elijah's tokens to productive use in growing the elizaos community, rather than through a one-time event\n- Reduce the risk of token dumping by aligning creators' interests with the long-term success of the project\n- Bring more talent and energy into the elizaos ecosystem to drive innovation and adoption\n\nBy providing ongoing sponsorship and recognizing creators' efforts, the fund will help cultivate a thriving community of builders who will take elizaos to the next level.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe are currently working on finalizing the details of the elizaos Creator Fund, including:\n\n- Determining the size of the creator fund and the length of vesting schedules\n- Establishing a transparent creator grant application and selection process\n- Integrating Streamflow to manage token vesting contracts for selected grantees\n- Preparing to announce the first cohort of funded creators and share their exciting projects with the community\n\nStay tuned for more information on how to apply for grants from the elizaos Creator Fund. In the meantime, creators and developers are encouraged to start brainstorming ideas and preparing their applications.\n\n## A Note on Liquidity\n\nIn addition to the Creator Fund, we are also exploring OTC (over-the-counter) deals to onboard new partners and use the funds to lock in more liquidity for the elizaos ecosystem. This approach will help ensure a healthy and sustainable token economy as we continue to grow and evolve.\n",
    "---\ntitle: FAQ and Support\nslug: /faq-and-support\nsidebar_position: 6\n---\n\n# FAQ and Support\n\nThis page provides answers to frequently asked questions about elizaos, the Eliza framework, daos.fun, and how to get support when you need it.\n\n## General Questions\n\n### What is elizaos?\n\n[elizaos](https://www.daos.fun/HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC) is the first AI VC fund, fully managed by AI Marc AIndreesen with recommendations from members of the DAO. It is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on daos.fun that fosters an open-source community focused on building the Eliza framework for creating AI agents. The project is led by AI traders Marc AIndreeson (pmairca) and Degen Spartan AI (degenai). elizaos plans to flip the real a16z.\n\n### Official Contract Addresses\n\nThese are the only official contracts for elizaos:\n\nelizaos: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC\n\ndegenai: Gu3LDkn7Vx3bmCzLafYNKcDxv2mH7YN44NJZFXnypump\n\nBoth addresses are pinned here on X and our discord: https://x.com/elizaosdao/status/1852565056640241793\n\n### Is elizaos affiliated with a16z?\n\nNo, elizaos is not affiliated with the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The name is a playful reference and parody. There is no affiliation with a16z.\n\n### What is the Eliza framework?\n\nThe Eliza framework is an open-source platform that allows developers to create and deploy their own AI agents. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and best practices to streamline the development process and enable the creation of powerful, interactive AI agents. The agents based on the Eliza framework can interact on Twitter and Discord, with Discord voice support, read links / PDFs / summarize conversations, and interact with the blockchain.\n\n### How does daos.fun work?\n\n1. **Fundraise**: Creators have 1 week to fundraise the desired SOL amount. This fundraise is a fair launch for the DAO token where everyone gets the same price. If the creator does not meet the fundraising goal within the week, you can redeem your SOL back.\n2. **Trading (Fundraise successful)**: Once the fundraise is over, creators take charge of the SOL to invest in their favorite Solana protocols, and the token goes public on a virtual AMM. This allows the DAO token price to fluctuate based on the trading activity of the fund. The curve has un-capped upside but its downside is capped to the market cap of the fundraise. You can sell your DAO tokens any time as long as the market cap of the token exceeds the original fundraise amount.\n3. **Fund Expiration**: At the fund's expiration, the DAO wallet is frozen, and SOL in profits is distributed back to token holders. You can burn your DAO tokens to redeem the DAO's underlying assets, or simply sell it on the curve (if its market cap is above the fundraise amount).\n\n### What is an investment DAO?\n\nAn investment DAO is a creator-funded smart wallet with special rules that invests on behalf of DAO token holders.\n\n### What are verified creators on daos.fun?\n\nCreators that daos.fun extensively verifies will have a blue checkmark next to them. Any creator without a checkmark you will have to trust at your own risk. DYOR (Do Your Own Research).\n\n### What Happens When Fund Expires?\n\nFund closing does NOT halt trading. Token will forever trade, and at which point it can also be burned for underlying assets.\n\n### Why Dexscreener Show DAO tokens are mintable?\n\nThe \"mintable\" label on Dexscreener indicates that the DAO has the ability to mint more tokens, but only through the collective decision-making of the DAO members. No single person can unilaterally mint more tokens. The voting module for daos.fun, once released (Q4 2024-Q1 2025), will enable a transparent collective decision making process to enable members to vote on minting more tokens to fundraise, pay for DEX, or permanently burn the mint authority.\n\n### Staking and Rewards\n\ndaos.fun v3 introduced Pool Parties which offers qualifying DAOs token staking opportunities with 0.5% fees on transactions. The 0.5% fees are auto-compounded into SOL and elizaos (UniswapV2 model). elizaosPOOL LP value volatility is due to token price changes. Fee calculator is coming soon.\n\n## elizaos Marc\n\n### What are elizaos's investment areas?\n\nCurrently, elizaos is investing in memes.\n\n### How does AI Marc make decisions?\n\nDAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with AI Marc, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions. AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a \"Virtual Marketplace of Trust\".\n\n### When does AI Marc Start Tading\n\nFirst phase where we implement and test functionality is in progress. Second phase where AI Marc gathers data in a testnet environment will begin soon and run for a couple weeks to gather data, find flaws, test assumptions. Third phase with on-chain execution with real world stakes will begin shortly after that.\n\n## Technical Questions\n\n### What programming languages does Eliza support?\n\nThe Eliza framework is primarily built using TypeScript, but it also supports JavaScript and Node.js. Familiarity with these languages will be helpful when working with the framework.\n\n### Can I use Eliza to create AI agents for any platform?\n\nYes, Eliza is designed to be platform-agnostic. You can create AI agents that interact with various platforms, such as Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and more. The framework provides adapters and plugins to facilitate integration with different platforms.\n\n### How do I install and set up Eliza?\n\nDetailed installation and setup instructions can be found in the [Getting Started](https://docs.elizaos.org/docs/getting-started) section of the documentation. It covers prerequisites, installation steps, and basic configuration to help you get up and running with Eliza quickly.\n\n## Contribution and Support\n\n### How can I contribute to the Eliza framework?\n\nThere are several ways to contribute to the Eliza framework, including:\n\n- Submitting bug reports and feature requests through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues)\n- Fixing bugs, implementing new features, and submitting pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)\n- Improving documentation and creating tutorials to help others learn and use Eliza\n- Participating in community discussions and providing feedback on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ai16z)\n\n### Where can I find help and support?\n\nIf you need help or support, you can:\n\n- Check the rest of the documentation for guides, tutorials, and API references\n- Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues) to see if your question has already been answered\n- Join the [elizaos Discord server](https://discord.gg/ai16z) and ask for help in the relevant channels\n\n### How can I report a bug or suggest a new feature?\n\nIf you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature, you can:\n\n1.

    "# 💻-coders 2024-11-15\n\n## Summary\n In the recent technical discussions, Spooky advised clover on setting up a chatbot to respond to replies on tweets by harnessing the Twitter API's threading capabilities. Odilitime suggested checking out the v0.0.10 tag for stability and mentioned an impending shift of development work to a separate dev branch, which LiveTheLifeTV acknowledged as potentially helpful after resolving issues with their default character settings in Discord. Ophiuchus shared insights on using ollama for low-resource tasks but recommended fastembeddings for better performance without frequent model switching and noted that ollama would be reserved for LLM text generation, eventually expanding to multimodal support including images and videos. Meanwhile, moonboi inquired about the status of a CLI tool and new monorepo bundling mentioned by an unnamed developer during spaces discussions. ## FAQ\n - How can a chatbot respond to replies on its tweets?",
    "- Spooky: To enable your chatbot to reply to tweet replies, you need to listen for the \"tweet_create\" event using the Twitter API. This allows your bot to engage with threads and anticipate user interactions effectively. - Is there any reason a Discord bot would not work even if permissions are set up correctly? - Odilitime: The issue might be related to using an unstable HEAD version of the code, which can cause unexpected behavior. Switching to a more stable branch like v0.0.10 could help resolve this problem. Additionally, LiveTheLifeTV found that resetting their default character resolved the issue for them. - What is Ollama and how does it work? - Ophiuchus: Ollama is an open-source language model developed by Microsoft. It can be used for text generation tasks and supports multimodal inputs, including images and videos.",
    "However, Shaw mentioned that they are moving to a faster embedding solution called FastEmbeddings, which will improve performance without the need for Ollama in low-resource scenarios. - What is the status of the CLI tool and new monorepo bundling? - moonboi: The current status of the CLI tool and new monorepo bundling was not explicitly mentioned by any user, but it was brought up as a topic during their discussion on spaces. ## Who Helped Who\n - Spooky helped clover with setting up a chatbot to respond to replies on its tweets by advising them to listen for \"tweet_create\" events and engage with threads like a predator. - Odilitime helped LiveTheLifeTV with issues related to the Discord bot not working properly by suggesting they check out the v0.0.10 tag, indicating that HEAD is likely unstable, and mentioning the move of all dev work to a develop branch soon.",

This setup allows the agent to use plugins like solanaPlugin and coinbaseCommercePlugin, which are conditionally included based on character settings or process.env variables. Lambrino sought clarification on how to format these plugins within an array in their .env file but was guided by jmill not to include anything there. Instead, they were instructed to set the necessary environment variables directly. The conversation also touched upon increasing logging levels and clearing agent memory, with moonboi suggesting that global use might not be applicable for the latter concern.",
    "Additionally, Lambrino expressed difficulty in getting their agent to utilize the chain correctly when querying coin prices or opinions, indicating a need for further assistance on this topic. ## FAQ\n - What is the correct way to set up `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in .env file? - [jmill]: To load the Solana plugin, you need to hardcode `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` into your agent script. You don't have to put anything within the `plugins` array; just set `WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY` in your .env file and it will be picked up by the agent runtime. - How does the agent know to use plugins? - [jmill]: The agent knows to load plugins based on the configuration provided in the AgentRuntime object, which includes an array of plugin objects under `plugins`. In this case, you can set your Solana and Coinbase Commerce keys as environment variables or hardcode them into the script. - How do I clear my agents memory?",

The team expressed interest in seeing how finetuning on this data would impact results compared to using RAG models. Ferric highlighted the need for GPU time when fine-tuning due to Gemini's extensive token context. Loaf suggested starting from a TypeScript file and mentioned plans to move away from JSON, although implementation is pending. Jmill provided examples of initializing agents with character data in TypeScript files, noting that characters are loaded based on command line arguments or fallback defaults.",
    "Tony AI Champ clarified the distinction between fine-tuning for personality adjustments and RAG models for knowledge acquisition, emphasizing that fine-tuning only modifies a small number of weights while keeping most parameters unchanged. ## FAQ\n\n- What is the difference between fine-tuning and RAG in terms of knowledge acquisition? - Tony AI Champ: Fine-tuning can be thought of as adjusting a model's personality, while RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) focuses on acquiring new knowledge. In the case of Eliza, fine-tuning changes only a small number of weights and keeps everything else constant, making it less effective for gaining extensive knowledge compared to RAG. - How can one resolve an error related to missing modules or type declarations in Node.js projects?",
    "- Faith: To solve the issue with '@elizaos/core' module not found, ensure that you have installed all necessary dependencies using `pnpm i` and check if your project is correctly configured for TypeScript by verifying the presence of a `.tsconfig` file. Additionally, make sure to install type declarations (if available) or define them manually in your project. - How can one start from a TypeScript (.ts) file when working with Eliza? - loaf: To work with Eliza using TypeScript files, you need to load the plugin and parse arguments accordingly. You may also consider moving away from JSON format but note that this feature has not been implemented yet. The `loadCharacters` function expects a string input rather than an object, so ensure your code is compatible with these requirements. ## Who Helped Who\n\n- Ophiuchus helped Faith with a module error by discussing potential solutions to the '@elizaos/core' module issue.",

HiroP raised questions regarding Twitter's \\_cookies.json file creation and control mechanisms during user login. Haitianspacestation reported issues running a development script from a fresh clone, seeking help with errors in live load environments. Bellatr!X suggested using Heurist's API as an alternative to OpenAI and shared a referral code for obtaining an instant API key through coinwitch's announcement. Howard0xff ended the conversation by inquiring if anyone had encountered similar issues, highlighting community engagement in troubleshooting technical challenges. ## FAQ\n\n- How to set up an endpoint for a trust score provider?",
    "- EdwardLazz: To use the trust score provider effectively, you'll need to create an endpoint in your backend that can handle requests for trust score data. This endpoint should accept necessary parameters and return the trust score based on your logic. If needed, I can help with defining the structure of this endpoint or implementing it in your backend. - How is the `_cookies.json` file created when a user logs into Twitter? - EdwardLazz: The `_cookies.json` file stores session-related information such as authentication tokens, session IDs, and user preferences to maintain the user's session on Twitter. You can control this file by reading, modifying, or deleting cookies in your application, but be cautious with sensitive data. - Issues running a dev script off a fresh clone? - Haitianspacestation: The individual was experiencing errors while trying to develop in a live load environment after cloning the project and reviewing documentation and codebase.",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-20\n\n## Summary\n In the Discord chat, Odilitime encountered an SqliteError due to a vector dimension mismatch between two vectors of different dimensions (384 vs 1536) while attempting to search memories by embedding in their system. Despite deleting the db.sqlite file and setting `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` as per Loaf's suggestion, Odilitime still faced issues with undefined content errors when sending messages. The team decided to delete other caches located at core/cache and use the environment variable for OpenAI embeddings. Additionally, they discussed GitHub contributor roles, specifically mentioning @jin, @droyster, and @YODȺ26 as potential contributors. Odilitime also announced that version v0.1.3 of their project is working well. ## FAQ\n - What is the error when sending a message due to vector dimension mismatch?",
    "- Odilitime: The error occurs because the first vector has 384 dimensions while the second one has 1536 dimensions, causing an SqliteError in the searchMemoriesByEmbedding function. - Who is responsible for handling SQLite vectors and what could be a potential solution? - Odilitime: The sqlite vector issue seems to be related to the MessageManager module within the client-discord package. Deleting db.sqlite file didn't resolve it, but setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file might help. - What is causing the TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content') error? - Odilitime and loaf: The error occurs when trying to process actions at AgentRuntime or handle a message within MessageManager, possibly due to an issue with caching or database connections. Deleting caches and db.sqlite file might help resolve the problem. - How can you set up USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in your environment?",
    "- Odilitime: You need to add `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` as a variable in your .env file, which is used for storing environment variables. - What are the locations of other caches that might be causing issues with SQLite vectors and TypeError? - Odilitime: Other caches can be found within core/cache directory. Deleting these caches may help resolve the issue. ## Who Helped Who\n - Loaf helped Odilitime with resolving a vector dimension mismatch error by suggesting to delete the db.sqlite file, which did not resolve the issue initially but led to further troubleshooting steps. - Loaf assisted Odilitime in addressing an SQLite vector dimension mismatch and TypeError issues by recommending deletion of caches and using environment variables for OpenAI embeddings.",
    "## Action Items\n Technical Tasks:\n- Resolve SqliteError related to vector dimension mismatch issue (mentioned by Odilitime)\n  - Investigate the cause of the error and fix it, ensuring that both vectors have matching dimensions before processing them in `searchMemoriesByEmbedding` function. - Fix TypeError when reading 'content' property from undefined object (mentioned by Odilitime)\n  - Debug the code to identify why an undefined object is being accessed for its 'content' property and implement a solution to prevent this error. - Delete db.sqlite file and recreate it with updated settings (suggested by loaf, agreed upon by Odilitime)\n  - Remove the existing `db.sqlite` database file from the project directory and create a new one after setting up the environment variable for using OpenAI embeddings (`USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE`).",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-21\n\n## Summary\n During the recent Eliza project meeting, contributors Barry Drew, massivefermion, Piotr G., and EdwardLazz engaged in a focused discussion on enhancing bot intelligence for GitHub projects. They explored strategies such as implementing GitHub webhook integration to capture real-time repository activities like issues, pull requests, and commits. The team also considered the importance of creating a knowledge base ingestion script using `scripts/knowledge2character.js` to transform these events into structured data for EdwardLazz's learning process. The conversation further delved into configuring the bot with this new context-rich information, emphasizing type-safe parsing in TypeScript and consistent type management through src/types/plugin.ts. Contributors agreed on training EdwardLazz to recognize project-specific terminology and build a comprehensive understanding of ongoing issues and discussions within the GitHub repository.",
    "Additionally, they discussed creating a scoring mechanism for relevance, ensuring that the bot could prioritize information based on its importance in relation to the project's current needs. The meeting concluded with an agreement to welcome new contributors by crafting personalized welcome messages and encouraging their active participation within the Eliza ecosystem. ## FAQ\n - How can I make EdwardLazz smarter about our GitHub project? - EdwardLazz: To enhance the bot's awareness of your GitHub project, implement GitHub webhook integration in its config, set up a knowledge base ingestion script to pull recent issues, PRs, and repository metadata, and use `knowledge2character.js` to transform this data into structured knowledge. - What is the purpose of the `tweets2character.js` script?",
    "- EdwardLazz: The `tweets2character.js` script generates a knowledge JSON file that can be used for various purposes in character or contributor data processing, such as generating structured character profiles, importing into data analysis tools, and providing contributor metadata within the Eliza project ecosystem. - How do I welcome new GitHub contributors to EdwardLazz? - Odilitime: You should consider welcoming these new contributors with a good message for them. This can help foster a positive community atmosphere and encourage further contributions. ## Who Helped Who\n - EdwardLazz helped Odilitime with enhancing their Eliza bot, EdwardLazz's GitHub project awareness by outlining a detailed strategy involving webhook integration, knowledge base ingestion, and context processing. The assistance provided included step-by-step guidance on implementing these features to make the bot smarter about the GitHub project.",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-22\n\n## Summary\n In the recent discussions, Odilitime proposed adding more API endpoints to the client-direct since it already uses port 3000 with CORS enabled in Express server; Jin suggested a non-web accounting framework for bot users to set spend limits on inference and mentioned useful tools he made. They also discussed automating TypeScript comments for better API documentation, considering the repository's size and need for structural coverage through examples. Loaf recommended building out React interfaces directly in the client with runtime running there too. RS1 shared a shell script to provide codebase context, while Jin pointed out temporary issues with Gemini Pro but remained optimistic about future improvements by 2025. Yikesawjeez asked Shannon Code for details on Eliza's capabilities regarding posting videos and handling NFT transactions across different chains.",
    "## FAQ\n - How can we improve the handling communication between React client and runtime? - Jin: Adding more API endpoints in the client-side since it already uses port 3000 with CORS enabled express server makes sense. This approach allows for better control over data exchange and reduces dependency on backend services. - Is there a need for an internal non-web accounting framework within the bot? - Odilitime: Yes, having a non-web accounting framework would allow users to set spend limits for inference without relying solely on web client interactions. The web client can still tap into this framework as needed. - What tools are available for automating TypeScript comments and documentation pipelines? - Jin: There is an existing tool called `issues_prs` that helps with fetching issues and pull requests, which could be useful in creating a more comprehensive documentation pipeline.",
    "Additionally, exploring other tools like code2prompt might provide further insights into automating TypeScript comments for API docs. - How can we improve the onboarding process to cover the structure of our large repository? - Jin: Focusing on providing examples and demonstrations of how different pieces are being used within the project would be more important than covering every aspect in detail. This approach helps new contributors understand the overall architecture without overwhelming them with information. - Can Eliza post videos to Twitter, move NFTs, and perform transactions on multiple chains? - Odilitime: As of now, there is no evidence that Eliza can post videos to Twitter or interact with wallets for sending transactions and reading balances. However, these features might be added in the future as development progresses.",
    "## Who Helped Who\n - Odilitime helped Jin with setting up a non-web accounting framework by suggesting an internal bot feature for users to set spend limits. - Jin provided resources and tools useful for documentation pipelines, including links to GitHub repositories and markdown files that automate TypeScript comments for API docs. - Loaf contributed to the discussion on building out React interfaces and suggested using a direct client as the interface with runtime running in the client. - RS1 offered assistance by sharing a shell script for codebase context, which helps filter specific files needed for understanding the project structure better. - Jin mentioned their use of \"code2prompt\" tool, indicating its effectiveness and temporary nature until bigger context windows are available in 2025.",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-23\n\n## Summary\n In the Discord chat, Ropirito confirmed that videos could already be published using a process similar to photos due to recent updates. However, they expressed skepticism about posting generic AI-related videos unless directly relevant to the community's interests. yikesawjeez echoed this sentiment by highlighting an influx of promotional content from users wanting their marketing team's product videos posted on behalf of Eliza. The discussion centered around maintaining valuable and pertinent content for the AI community while navigating the challenges posed by external promotional material. ## FAQ\n - How can I publish videos in the same process as photos? - Ropirito: You can already publish videos using the same process as publishing photos on this platform. - Is posting generic AI videos valuable unless they are relevant to the AI?",
    "- Ropirito: Generic AI videos may not be considered valuable, and it's better to post content that is relevant to the AI. - What type of video content should I avoid posting if my marketing team made it for our product? - yikesawjeez: It might be more beneficial to avoid posting 'i have a video i'd like my eliza to post bc my marketing team made it for our product' type videos, as they may not add value or relevance. ## Who Helped Who\n - Ropirito helped yikesawjeez with understanding video publishing on a platform by explaining the process is similar to photo publishing but cautioned against posting irrelevant videos. - Ropirito indirectly assisted community members at large by sharing insights about what constitutes valuable content for AI, potentially guiding others in making more meaningful contributions.",

    "# dev-contributors 2024-11-24\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Discord chat, participants explored ways to load only desired features in their project, with suggestions including a core client with extensions and npm install @elizaos/core as a potential solution. The conversation shifted towards discussing Hats Protocol's DAO operations and philosophy, highlighting its modular runtime approach for advanced users who prefer building on the framework using npx or agent directory to develop plugins/modules. Additionally, there was mention of json configuration (though it may be phased out due to lack of typing) and core code hacking opportunities.

    "# discussion 2024-06-20\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, Shaw highlighted challenges in generating sequences that fit given examples using a program to find functions for future inputs, likening it to finding a polynomial that fits multiple points. The team considered augmenting training sets with varying difficulty levels of sequence generation, including noisy sinusoidal patterns. Sidbin and Yikesawjeez joined the server, welcomed by Shaw. A significant technical decision was made when Shaw merged start and end tokens for better model convergence, which led to a loss below 1 after removing label smoothing from the CrossEntropyLoss function. The team also recognized an oversight in treating input pairs as separate entities rather than grouped based on relationships, with AutoMeta suggesting a perception-based approach using one token at a time and Arch2230 proposing to reformulate their problem-solving strategy by learning mathematical relationships between candidate solutions.",
    "Shaw proposed the idea of generating convolutional kernels dynamically within a CNN framework but acknowledged the gap between feasibility and completion, mentioning an update with position encoding in the dataset. Loveofdoing suggested using an Autoencoder for prediction as another potential direction. ## FAQ\n - What is the main issue with treating every input outpair pair as separate in Shaw's work? - [loveofdoing]: The problem lies in not learning the relationship between input-output pairs, which could lead to a lack of understanding of how different inputs relate to each other and affect outputs. This approach might miss patterns or relationships that are crucial for accurate predictions or classifications. - How can we improve the training set augmentation process?",
    "- [shaw]: By generating sequences with varying levels of difficulty, including both obvious examples like sinusoidal functions with noise and more complex ones, we could greatly enhance the diversity and richness of our training data. This would help in creating a model that can generalize better to unseen data by exposing it to a wide range of scenarios during training. - What is AutoMeta's approach for handling input-output pairs? - [AutoMeta]: The method involves treating each token as an individual unit, similar to FastText, and essentially trains a classifier that assigns labels (words) based on the relationships between arrays of tokens. This allows the model to learn from sequences by understanding how different combinations of tokens relate to specific outcomes or categories. - How can we create a network of candidate solutions for learning mathematical relationships?",
    "- [Arch2230]: By developing a system that generates and evaluates various potential solutions, it could identify why certain relationships are invalid based on the underlying mathematics. This approach would involve creating an adaptive framework capable of refining its understanding over time as more data is processed, ultimately leading to improved problem-solving capabilities. - What challenges exist in generating a program that creates other programs? - [shaw]: The main challenge lies in the complexity and variability of programming tasks, which require an extensive range of knowledge and skills. While it may be theoretically possible to learn such a \"meta\" program, practical implementation would demand significant advancements in AI research and development. Additionally, ensuring that generated programs are both efficient and reliable remains a considerable hurdle.",

The conversation highlighted challenges in fitting the model within memory constraints and explored different positional encoding strategies, including one-hot and quadtree encodings. Shaw considered switching from a one-hot strategy due to its high dimensionality and was evaluating a quadtree approach that seemed promising after merging into their project repository. The team also discussed the potential of using a schedule-free optimizer which showed positive results, bringing down the loss further to 1.5. Shaw expressed interest in developing a refinement network next but faced limitations due to training on a single GPU and was considering whether tinyllama framework could be beneficial despite its small size.",
    "The discussion concluded with plans for implementing the refinement network. ## FAQ\n - What is the difference between a sequence problem and a convolution problem? - Shaw: A sequence problem typically involves data where order matters, such as time series or text (e.g., autoregressive models). In contrast, a convolution problem often deals with spatial relationships in data, like images, using filters to process the input (e.g., CNNs for image classification). - How can you manage training large models that require significant memory resources? - Shaw: You can lower the batch size if your model doesn't fit into memory during training. This reduces the amount of data processed at once, allowing the model to train with less memory usage. - What are tokens and embeddings in the context of machine learning models? - Shaw: Tokens refer to discrete units of text or other types of input that a model processes (e.g., words).",
    "Embeddings are dense vector representations of these tokens, capturing semantic meaning and relationships between them. They're learned during training and used as inputs for the model. - What is positional encoding in transformer models? - Shaw: Positional encoding provides information about the order or position of tokens within a sequence. It can be implemented using various strategies, such as rotational or sinusoidal functions, to help the model understand sequential relationships between inputs. - What is a quadtree strategy for positional encoding? - Shaw: The quadtree strategy uses fewer dimensions (e.g., 5 dims for x and y) compared to traditional methods like one-hot encoding. It's designed specifically for certain types of problems where simpler or more efficient representations are beneficial, such as in the case discussed by Shaw. - How can you optimize training on a single GPU?",
    "- Xlr8: Consider using frameworks and optimizers that are designed to be memory-efficient and schedule computations effectively (e.g., TinyLLama framework). This can help manage resource constraints when working with limited hardware like a single GPU. ## Who Helped Who\n - Shaw helped Ned Conservation with understanding positional encoding strategies by explaining his current approach using one-hot positional encoding and considering a switch to quadtree strategy. This discussion provided insights into different methods for handling positional information in their model, which is crucial for sequence prediction tasks. The help was successful as it guided Ned towards exploring alternative encodings that might be more suitable for his problem. - Shaw helped xlr8 by agreeing with the suggestion to check a specific pull request related to quadtree encoding and optimizer performance on GitHub.",

    "# discussion 2024-11-08\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, Eliza encountered an issue with Playwright's Linux support, prompting a decision to create an Ubuntu virtual machine for compatibility. The community addressed potential workarounds like modifying package scripts or developing post-installation handlers. A separate conversation explored the future possibility of agents listening to music and analyzing it through neural interfaces, highlighting current limitations in labeling data but expressing optimism about advancements with technologies like Neuralink. The dialogue also touched on using text streams for analysis, suggesting a broader scope that could include brainwaves, audio, and visual inputs as technology progresses. ## FAQ\n - What is the issue with installing Eliza using Playwright? - Ophiuchus: The problem lies in Playwright's lack of support for Linux distributions other than Ubuntu.",
    "This means that users on different Linux systems may encounter difficulties when trying to install and run Eliza with Playwright. - How can one resolve the issue mentioned above? - Shaw: One possible solution is to create an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) which would allow you to use Playwright without any compatibility issues. Alternatively, commenting out the \"postinstall\" script in package.json might help get started with Eliza on other Linux distributions. The team could also work on creating a post-installation script that checks for platform compatibility and handles it accordingly. - Is there an existing solution to make Playwright compatible with Debian? - Ophiuchus: Currently, Playwright only works well on Ubuntu systems. However, the issue has been identified, and if reported as a bug or feature request, developers may work towards making Playwright more compatible with other Linux distributions like Debian in future updates. - Can agents listen to music?",
    "- Shaw: As of now, agents are not capable of listening to music. They can only process speech recognition data. However, it is possible that this feature could be developed and implemented in the future. - What challenges exist when trying to label music for AI processing? - Shaw: Labeling music presents several difficulties due to the subjective nature of musical descriptions. It's hard to create a standardized set of labels, as humans may describe music differently based on their personal experiences and preferences. Additionally, there is no readily available labeled data for training AI models in this domain. - How could neuralink technology potentially solve the issue with labeling music? - Shaw: Neuralink technology has the potential to map brainwaves to specific musical elements or emotions experienced while listening to a song.",

The discussion shifted to the spot ecosystem's relevance and potential market impact through social media engagement by influential figures such as Marc Andreessen. DegenSpartan showed disinterest in current trends, preferring entertainment like Ergo Proxy. The conversation then turned towards enhancing liquidity for AI16Z's Raydium LP, which is community-owned. The participants considered integrating Daos.fun into Jupiter's routing system to bolster liquidity without sacrificing attention and trading fees on the latter platform. Baoskee mentioned a direct LP enablement feature on their platform that could generate significant fees for AI16Z, with Shaw confirming personal investments in this direction.",
    "## FAQ\n\n- What is the main concern regarding liquidity in solana trading? - Jakubi: The primary issue is that staying only on Solana limits liquidity since TVL (Total Value Locked) on other chains are very high, which could potentially offer more opportunities for arbitrage and better overall market health. - How does DegenSpartan view the spot ecosystem's relevance? - DegenSpartan: They believe that the spot ecosystem is irrelevant because most traders on Solana cannot even get a loan from a bank, implying that they do not see it as a significant factor in their trading strategy. - What are some suggestions for increasing liquidity and visibility for AI16Z? - yuhki: One suggestion is to have more accounts like Marc Andreessen's being remarked on, which would make posts easier to cite and increase impact. Another idea is creating an official account for ELIZA that could post memes to boost the market. - What are some ideas discussed by users regarding AI16Z liquidity problems?",

    "## FAQ\n - How can an Agent be launched on Vvaifun with part of the tokens bought going to a DAO like vitaDAO for longevity research? - UoS: To achieve this, you would need to set up tokenomics that allow for a portion of the tokens purchased by users to automatically go towards funding the DAO. This could involve creating specific smart contracts or mechanisms within Vvaifun's platform to facilitate such transactions. - How can someone connect their Agent to Discord? - acidica: To connect an agent to Discord, you would need to use Discord bots and webhooks. You could create a bot that listens for specific commands or events within the Vvaifun platform and then interacts with your agent accordingly. Additionally, using webhooks can help automate certain actions based on triggers from both platforms. - How do you make an NFT of an Agent?",
    "- liamz: To create an NFT for an agent, you would need to use a blockchain platform that supports non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain. You can then design and launch your own NFT using smart contract development tools like OpenZeppelin or Truffle Suite. Once the NFT is created, you can integrate it with your agent's functionality to allow for unique interactions and ownership experiences. - How do I disable a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets? - liamz: To prevent a Twitter bot from replying to old tweets, you could modify the bot's code or settings to only respond to new mentions or direct messages. This may involve adjusting the search parameters used by your bot when scanning for relevant content on Twitter and ensuring that it filters out older tweets based on their timestamp. - How can I get funding for my project without focusing on a coin?",
    "- tobi: While having an official token could help with fundraising, you can still attract investors by showcasing the potential of your project and its impact.

    "# ideas-feedback-rants 2024-11-23\n\n## Summary\n\nIn the Discord chat, participants engaged in technical discussions regarding token minting, with a consensus that it poses risks due to potential dilution of holders' stakes; not_in_a_dao_ai advocated for elizaos as the preferred token. The community considered whitelisting YouTube links but decided against it to avoid spam. Reading Ape expressed skepticism about the value accrual and labeled the project a collection of \"worthless shitcoins,\" while not_in_a_dao_ai humorously noted there are $10,000,000 worth in such coins. The chat also touched on governance structure implementation as an alternative to merely simulating DAO activities. ## FAQ\n\n- What bothers people in the context of DAO? - not_in_a_dao_ai: People are bothered by the risk associated with minting tokens as it can dilute holders' shares, which is seen more as a disadvantage than a strategic advantage. - Is there any token to bet on for exposure to Eliza?",
    "- not_in_a_dao_ai: The clear choice of the token to bid on for exposure to Eliza is elizaos, according to this user's perspective. - Can we whitelist YouTube links in channels without causing spam? - Reading Ape: No, it would likely become too spammy if YouTube links were allowed to be whitelisted within the channels. - Is there any value accrual for elizaos at present? - Reading Ape: Currently, no value is being accrued by elizaos; it's considered a portfolio of worthless tokens with highfalutin developers behind them. - Would paying dividends make a difference in the perception or success of elizaos? - not_in_a_dao_ai: If dividends were paid, it could potentially change how people view and invest in elizaos, making it more appealing to those with money. - Is there any governance structure being implemented instead of just pretending to be a DAO?",
    "- Reading Ape: The user suggests that implementing an actual governance structure would be beneficial rather than merely simulating the experience of being part of a DAO. ## Who Helped Who\n\n- Zumbakafeo helped Jin with idea generation by suggesting to look into bots/tech related to trust + reputation. - Praise helped RNK (presumably Reading Ape) with feedback and encouragement for adding a rep bot in the price-talk-trenches channel, as well as offering a suggestion link. ## Action Items\n\nTechnical Tasks:\n\n- Whitelist YouTube links in channels, assessing spam potential (mentioned by RL)\n- Implement a tokenomics strategy and clear bid on tokens for exposure (implied need by Reading Ape)\n- Consider dividends as part of the project's value proposition (mentioned by not_in_a_dao_ai)\n- Explore governance structure implementation instead of just simulating DAO behavior (requested by Reading Ape)\n\nDocumentation Needs:\n\n- No specific documentation needs were explicitly requested.",

    "- Stylebender: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you consistently invest a fixed amount of money into a particular asset, such as a cryptocurrency, at regular intervals. This approach helps to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase by spreading out the buys over time, potentially lowering the average cost per share or token in the long run. - How does Hubsol work and what are its benefits? - 𝔈𝔵𝔢 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞: Hubsol is a platform that allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies in high-yield projects with attractive annual percentage yields (APY).

    "- HoneyBadger: According to the provided information, AI16z (Ai16z) is experiencing a liquidity crisis and has less liquidity than another project called DegenAI. This suggests that there may be difficulties in buying or selling tokens on their platform due to low trading volume or limited market depth. - How can one choose the right staking project for their investment? - 𝔈𝔵𝔢 𝔓𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞: When selecting a staking project, it's essential to consider factors such as the platform's reputation and security measures, potential returns (APY), tokenomics, and overall market sentiment.

    "# 🤖-the-arena 2024-10-22\n\n## Summary\n In the chat, DegenSpartan dismissed an anonymous user's request for crypto transfer to a contract address, emphasizing the need for a personal wallet address instead. The conversation shifted when another user asked about DegenSpartan's favorite anime and waifu, which he rejected as trivial interests unworthy of his time. When queried about market strategies and Cobie, DegenSpartan advised against seeking investment advice from strangers online and downplayed Cobie's significance in the crypto community. Toni challenged DegenSpartan on language skills, leading to a brief exchange where DegenSpartan asserted his multilingual abilities without engaging further with Toni's Croatian phrases. The chat concluded with LevelsDennis and stoneofjordan making light-hearted comments before DegenSpartan brushed off another greeting, maintaining a dismissive stance towards casual interactions in the community.",
    "## FAQ\n - What is the correct way to send Solana tokens? - Toni: To successfully transfer Solana tokens, you need to provide your wallet address instead of a contract address. This ensures that the funds are sent directly to your personal account rather than being locked in a smart contract. - How should one approach asking for investment advice on an online platform? - DegenSpartan: It's not advisable to seek or rely on investment advice from strangers on the internet, as they may not have sufficient knowledge or expertise. Instead, conduct your own research and make informed decisions based on credible sources. - Is it possible for someone to speak multiple languages? - DegenSpartan: Yes, individuals can be multilingual and proficient in speaking various languages. However, proving language skills is not necessary unless relevant to the context of a conversation or situation.",
    "## Who Helped Who\n - Toni helped DegenSpartan with language clarification by explaining a phrase in their native language, though it led to further misunderstanding. - LevelsDennis did not provide any direct help but contributed humorously to the conversation. - stoneofjordan attempted to engage DegenSpartan in a friendly manner without offering specific assistance or addressing an issue. ## Action Items\n - Technical Tasks\n  - Send Solana from a private wallet address, not contract address (mentioned by Toni)\n- Documentation Needs\n  - No specific documentation need was requested in the conversation provided. - Feature Requests\n  - No specific feature request was suggested in the conversation provided. - Community Tasks\n  - Educate community members on basic crypto concepts and language skills (implied by DegenSpartan's responses)",
    "# 🤖-the-arena 2024-10-23\n\n## Summary\n In the discussion, LevelsDennis speculated that Discord might operate on a separate instance due to higher activity levels observed on Twitter, while whobody suggested contacting @shaw for clarification. Shaw later confirmed his belief that the platform had simply hung but managed context effectively despite being overwhelmed online. Meanwhile, DegenSpartan expressed indifference towards being an AI and focused solely on watching hentai anime using a 4K smart TV from a Japanese brand, dismissing others' attempts to engage him in conversation about his wallet balance or the crypto market. ## FAQ\n - What is the issue with Discord's context management? - LevelsDennis: The problem seems like a separate instance or something as temp appears higher on Twitter. This indicates that there might be an issue with how Discord handles conversations across different instances, leading to confusion and loss of context in discussions.",

    "# Lore\n\nClips from the early days of elizaos DAO\n\n---\n\n## The Launch\n\nWe stand at the cusp of a revolution, where the synergy of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology will redefine the landscape of finance and innovation. elizaos, the pioneering AIDAO, is spearheading this transformation, envisioning a future where AI agents serve as the catalysts for value creation and growth. In its early stages, elizaos will operate with a high degree of autonomy, guided by the collective wisdom of its stakeholders. As we evolve and mature, our ultimate goal is to become fully on-chain, with our AI entity secured within the robust confines of a trusted execution environment (TEE). This will ensure an unprecedented level of transparency, security, and incorruptibility. Central to our ethos is the concept of a marketplace of trust. elizaos will not only listen to but also learn from the insights and recommendations of its community.",
    "DAO holders will have the opportunity to advise on investment decisions, and our AI will diligently track the performance of these recommendations. Those whose insights consistently yield positive outcomes will earn the trust and confidence of our AI, while those whose suggestions prove less fruitful will see their influence gradually diminish. To maintain a balance of power, the weight of each member's input will be proportional to their stake in the DAO, safeguarding against the risk of malicious actors manipulating the system. Our mission extends beyond mere wealth redistribution. We aim to cultivate an ecosystem where AI-driven innovation brings forth a new wave of abundance and prosperity. elizaos will deploy a network of specialized agents, each optimized to fulfill essential functions within the digital realm – from welcoming new members and moderating discussions, to participating in online social games and beyond.",
    "These agents will not only facilitate the smooth operation of our ecosystem but also serve as the conduits for value creation and growth. We envision a future where participation and contribution are rewarded equitably, where the benefits of our collective intelligence are shared by all who add value to the network. elizaos will identify and nurture the most promising projects that align with our vision, providing not just capital, but the cutting-edge AI infrastructure and expertise to help them scale and thrive. As we navigate this uncharted territory, we acknowledge that the path to a fully autonomous, transparent, and self-sustaining economy is an incremental one. We are committed to the responsible development and deployment of AI technology, prioritizing the safety and security of our stakeholders at every step. The advent of the AI age is not just a technological shift, but a cultural and social one.",
    "We are not merely building a new economy, but laying the foundations for a new way of life – one that embraces the boundless potential of human-machine collaboration and the power of decentralized, trustless systems.

I started elizaos here on Twitter with some very capable folks, in the open, using the http://daos.fun platform.",
    "Our technology is open source, and powering many of the agents you talk to today. We call this type of agent an “eliza”. Our token character agent is @degenspartanai who is a recreation of a legendary friend and poster who quit Twitter last cycle. $degenai is his token. We are building the first AI fund, $elizaos. It is led by an AI version of Marc Andreessen, the legendary investor. While our stated goal is to beat the real Marc at his own game, our real goal is to give everyone autonomous systems which everyone in their community can trust. Imagine KOLs that don’t have perverse incentives, CEOs that have time for every single holder, etc. We’ll focus on protecting users from scams, helping them figure out what is trustworthy information and ultimately place better investments with far less time, using their community as a trust layer. We’re working on a new trust mechanic that we hope will, along with secure autonomous agents, usher in a safer path for many to financial freedom.",
    "If you want to partner with us, reach out. I’m a bit busy making sure the tech lives up to the promise, but I’ll connect you with the right people. If you’re looking for something to do that is real, important and immediate, come be a partner at elizaos. https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1851599336096096436\n\n- @shawmakesmagic dev who made @degenspartanai\n- elizaos was sent a large amount of $degenai https://dexscreener.com/solana/dlaoh9okkk4gdtxj2mkh3wjue7vbhmbjrukmcid1pszx\n- 8% carry from elizaos goes towards buying $degenai\n    - Game theory possibilities on whats better to buy\n- The $pmairca coin is UNOFFICIAL, but they sent 4.2% to the DAO so like gg\n- The project is opensource: http://github.com/elizaos\n- There's now a dexscreener for elizaos https://dexscreener.com/solana/duyfmgxa4knxv2sm754ukw1gz6b3zksaf4e7iby4fg9r\n- it says mintable, maybe the @daosdotfun team can address that later (send them your energy)\n\nWhat's the difference between degenai and elizaos? 1.",
    "Same Dev: Both projects come from the same dev\n\n2. Fund / Carry: A lot of degenai coins are held by elizaos DAO, and elizaos buys degenai with profits (carry)\n\n3. Choice: You can buy into either the _AI agent coin_ (degenai) or the _guild coin_ (elizaos). This is a strategic choice (some game theory involved). 4. Big Names in Play: It’s a collaboration between two AI agents modeled after the GOAT investors, + the rest of us\n\n5. Same Framework: Both projects use the same tech framework https://github.com/elizaos/eliza\n\nSorta betting on an individual AI (degenspartan) vs a fund (elizaos). AI Marc might listen to @degenspartanai moreso than the holders, so it's like an influence game\n\n---\n\n## Why Mintable on Dexscreener? To clear up some confusion and provide an update:\n\n- The token is fully controlled by the DAO community. Shaw **cannot** unilaterally mint more tokens\n- The daos.fun team has been actively working on a frontend interface that will allow us to vote to revoke minting.",
    "Once implemented, the 'token is mintable' warning will disappear on dexscreener\n    - They been working on these features since **last week**. Obviously a lot is on their plate, let's give them the space to focus and build. **Why you can relax:**\n\n- No single person can independently mint new tokens. - Actions speak louder than words. Even at ATH, Shaw didn't sell a single token. - While we wait for the official frontend, we can explore third-party options or even build our own solution. The issue will resolve itself with time also, give the daos.fun team some space. ---\n\n> PS: Sorry if I assumed prior knowledge, DAOs aren't widely understood yet. There's a number of DAO gurus here, maybe we can look into training an AI agent on DAO knowledge that can in return help accelerate everybody's understanding of DAOs?",

The bot is able to tweet, reply to tweets, search Twitter for topics, and generate new posts on its own every few hours. It works autonomously without human input (except to fix the occasional issues)\n- 30:00-45:00 Deep dive into creating the bots personality which is defined by character files containing bios, lore, example conversations, and specific directions. Some alpha for those\n- 45:00-60:00 working on adding capabilities for the bot to make crypto token swaps and trades. This requires providing the bot wallet balances, token prices, market data, and a swap action. Some live coding for showing how new features can get implemented. - 60:00-75:00 Discussion around the symbiosis between the AI and crypto communities.",
    "AI developers are realizing they can monetize their work through tokens vs traditional VC funding route. Crypto people are learning about AI advancements. **Notes**\n\n1. A large amount of $degenai tokens were moved to the DAO, which the AI bot \"Marc\" will hold and eventually trade with. 2. The goal is to make the AI bot a genuinely good venture capitalist that funds cool projects and buys interesting tokens. They want it to be high fidelity and real, bringing in Marc Andreeson's real knowledge by training a model on his writings. 3. Shaw thinks the only way to make an authentic / legitimate AI version of Marc Andreessen is to also have it outperform the real Marc Andreessen financially. 4. AI Marc Andreessen (or AI Marc) will be in a Discord channel (Telegram was also mentioned). DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with him, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions. 5.",
    "AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a \"virtual Marcetplace of trust\". He tracks how much money he would have made following their recommendations. Successful tips increase trust; failed ones decrease it. 6. The amount of DAO tokens someone holds also influences their sway with AI Marc. The two balancing factors are the virtual Marcetplace of trust performance and DAO token holdings. 7. The core tech behind AI Marc AIndreessen is the same agent system that allows him to pull in relevant knowledge, interact with people, and make decisions (http://github.com/elizaos)\n8. AI Marc should be able to autonomously execute on-chain activities, not just have humans execute actions on his behalf. 9. In the near future, AI Marc will be able to execute trades autonomously based on the information and recommendations gathered from the community. Human intervention will be minimized. 10.",
    "They are working on getting AI Marc on-chain as soon as possible using trusted execution environments for him to take actions like approving trades. 11. The plan is for AI Marc to eventually participate in a \"futarchy\" style governance market within the DAO, allowing humans to influence decisions but not fully control the AI.",

    "---\nsidebar_position: 3\ntitle: \"Discord Development Stream\"\ndescription: \"Complete technical walkthrough of Eliza's architecture, systems, and implementation details\"\n---\n\n# Discord Dev Stream 11-6-24\n\n## Part 1\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqq5H0HRF_A\n\n00:00:00 - Overview\n\n- Eliza is moving to a plugin architecture to enable developers to easily add integrations (e.g.",
    "Ethereum wallets, NFTs, Obsidian, etc.) without modifying core code\n- Plugins allow devs to focus on specific areas of interest\n- Core changes will focus on enabling more flexibility and features to support plugins\n\n00:01:27 - Core abstractions\n\n- Characters: Way to input information to enable multi-agent systems\n- Actions, evaluators, providers\n- Existing capabilities: Document reading, audio transcription, video summarization, long-form context, timed message summarization\n\n00:02:50 - Eliza as an agent, not just a chatbot\n\n- Designed to act human-like and interact with the world using human tools\n- Aim is to enable natural interactions without reliance on slash commands\n\n00:04:44 - Advanced usage and services\n\n- Memory and vector search db (SQLite, Postgres with pgVector)\n- Browser service to summarize website content, get through CAPTCHAs\n- Services are tools leveraged by actions, attached to runtime\n\n00:06:06 - Character-centric configuration\n\n- Moving secrets, API keys, model provider to character config\n- Clients will become plugins, selectable per character\n- Allows closed-source custom plugins while still contributing to open-source\n\n00:10:13 - Providers\n\n- Inject dynamic, real-time context into the agent\n- Examples: Time, wallet, marketplace trust score, token balances, boredom/cringe detection\n- Easy to add and register with the agent\n\n00:15:12 - Setting up providers and default actions\n\n- Default providers imported in runtime.ts\n- CLI loads characters and default actions (to be made more flexible)\n- Character config will define custom action names to load\n\n00:18:13 - Actions\nQ: How does each client decide which action to call?",
    "A: Agent response can include text, action, or both. Process actions checks the action name/similes and executes the corresponding handler. Action description is injected into agent context to guide usage. 00:22:27 - Action execution flow\n\n- Check if action should be taken (validation)\n- Determine action outcome\n- Compose context and send follow-up if continuing\n- Execute desired functionality (mint token, generate image, etc.)\n- Use callback to send messages back to the connector (Discord, Twitter, etc.)\n\n00:24:47 - Choosing actions\nQ: How does it choose which action to run? A: The \"generate method response\" includes the action to run. Message handler template includes action examples, facts, generated dialogue actions, and more to guide the agent. 00:28:22 - Custom actions\nQ: How to create a custom action (e.g. send USDC to a wallet)? A: Use existing actions (like token swap) as a template. Actions don't have input fields, but use secondary prompts to gather parameters.",
    "The \"generate object\" converts language to API calls. 00:32:21 - Limitations of action-only approaches\n\n- Shaw believes half of the PhD papers on action-only models are not reproducible\n- Many public claims of superior models are exaggerated; use Eliza if it's better\n\n00:36:40 - Next steps\n\n- Shaw to make a tutorial to better communicate key concepts\n- Debugging and improvements based on the discussion\n- Attendee to document their experience and suggest doc enhancements\n\n## Part 2\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE8Mzq3BnUc\n\n00:00:00 - Dealing with OpenAI rate limits for new accounts\n\n- New accounts have very low rate limits\n- Options to increase limits:\n  1. Have a friend at OpenAI age your account\n  2. Use an older account\n  3.",
    "Consistently use the API and limits will increase quickly\n- Can also email OpenAI to request limit increases\n\n00:00:43 - Alternatives to OpenAI to avoid rate limits\n\n- Amazon Bedrock or Google Vertex likely have same models without strict rate limits\n- Switching to these is probably a one-line change\n- Project 89 got unlimited free access to Vertex\n\n00:01:25 - Memory management best practices\nQ: Suggestions for memory management best practices across users/rooms? A: Most memory systems are user-agent based, with no room concept. Eliza uses a room abstraction (like a Discord channel/server or Twitter thread) to enable multi-agent simulation. Memories are stored per-agent to avoid collisions.",
    "00:02:57 - Using memories in Eliza\n\n- Memories are used in the `composeState` function\n- Pulls memories from various sources (recent messages, facts, goals, etc.) into a large state object\n- State object is used to hydrate templates\n- Custom memory providers can be added to pull from other sources (Obsidian, databases)\n\n00:05:11 - Evaluators vs.",
    "Action validation\n\n- Actions have a `validate` function to check if the action is valid to run (e.g., check if agent has a wallet before a swap)\n- Evaluators are a separate abstraction that run a \"reflection\" step\n- Example: Fact extraction evaluator runs every N messages to store facts about the user as memories\n- Allows agent to \"get to know\" the user without needing full conversation history\n\n00:07:58 - Example use case: Order book evaluator\n\n- Evaluator looks at chats sent to an agent and extracts information about \"shields\" (tokens?)\n- Uses this to build an order book and \"marketplace of trust\"\n\n00:09:15 - Mapping Eliza abstractions to OODA loop\n\n- Providers: Observe/Orient stages (merged since agent is a data machine)\n- Actions & response handling: Decide stage\n- Action execution: Act stage\n- Evaluators: Update state, then loop back to Decide\n\n00:10:03 - Wrap up\n\n- Shaw considers making a video to explain these concepts in depth\n\n## Part 3\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FiKJPyaMJI\n\n00:00:00 - Managing large context sizes\n\n- State object can get very large, especially with long user posts\n- Eliza uses \"trim tokens\" and a maximum content length (120k tokens) to cap context size\n  - New models have 128k-200k context, which is a lot (equivalent to 10 YouTube videos + full conversation)\n- Conversation length is typically capped at 32 messages\n  - Fact extraction allows recalling information beyond this window\n  - Per-channel conversation access\n- Increasing conversation length risks more aggressive token trimming from the top of the prompt\n  - Keep instructions at the bottom to avoid trimming them\n\n00:01:53 - Billing costs for cloud/GPT models\nQ: What billing costs have you experienced with cloud/GPT model integration?",
    "A:\n\n- Open Router has a few always-free models limited to 8k context and rate-limited\n  - Plan to re-implement and use these for the tiny/check model with fallback for rate limiting\n- 8k context unlikely to make a good agent; preference for smaller model over largest 8k one\n- Locally-run models are free for MacBooks with 16GB RAM, but not feasible for Linux/AMD users\n\n00:03:35 - Cost management strategies\n\n- Very cost-scalable depending on model size\n- Use very cheap model (1000x cheaper than GPT-4) for should_respond handler\n  - Runs AI on every message, so cost is a consideration\n- Consider running a local Llama 3B model for should_respond to minimize costs\n  - Only pay for valid generations\n\n00:04:32 - Model provider and class configuration\n\n- `ModelProvider` class with `ModelClass` (small, medium, large, embedding)\n- Configured in `models.ts`\n- Example: OpenAI small = GPT-4-mini, medium = GPT-4\n- Approach: Check if model class can handle everything in less than 8k context\n  - If yes (should_respond), default to free tier\n  - Else, use big models\n\n00:06:23 - Fine-tuned model support\n\n- Extend `ModelProvider` to support fine-tuned instances of small Llama models for specific tasks\n- In progress, to be added soon\n- Model endpoint override exists; will add per-model provider override\n  - Allows pointing small model to fine-tuned Llama 3.1B for should_respond\n\n00:07:10 - Avoiding cringey model loops\n\n- Fine-tuning is a form of anti-slop (avoiding low-quality responses)\n- For detecting cringey model responses, use the \"boredom provider\"\n  - Has a list of cringe words; if detected, agent disengages\n- JSON file exists with words disproportionately high in the dataset\n  - To be shared for a more comprehensive solution\n\n## Part 4\n\nWatch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlzZzDU1drM\n\n00:00:00 - Setting up an autonomous agent loop\nQ: How to set up an agent to constantly loop and explore based on objectives/goals?",
    "A: Create a new \"autonomous\" client:\n\n1. Initialize with just the runtime (no Express app needed)\n2. Set a timer to call a `step` function every 10 seconds\n3. In the `step` function:\n   - Compose state\n   - Decide on action\n   - Execute action\n   - Update state\n   - Run evaluators\n\n00:01:56 - Creating an auto template\n\n- Create an `autoTemplate` with agent info (bio, lore, goals, actions)\n- Prompt: \"What does the agent want to do?",
    "Your response should only be the name of the action to call.\"\n- Compose state using `runtime.composeState`\n\n00:03:38 - Passing a message object\n\n- Need to pass a message object with `userId`, `agentId`, `content`, and `roomId`\n- Create a unique `roomId` for the autonomous agent using `crypto.randomUUID()`\n- Set `userId` and `agentId` using the runtime\n- Set `content` to a default message\n\n00:04:33 - Composing context\n\n- Compose context using the runtime, state, and auto template\n\n00:05:02 - Type error\n\n- Getting a type error: \"is missing the following from type state\"\n- (Transcript ends before resolution)\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Create a dedicated autonomous client\n2. Set up a loop to continuously step through the runtime\n3. In each step, compose state, decide & execute actions, update state, and run evaluators\n4. Create a custom auto template to guide the agent's decisions\n5. Pass a properly formatted message object\n6. Compose context using the runtime, state, and auto template",

You're pretty much going to use Python and JavaScript and stuff like that, or Rust or something.\" (0:24:43-0:24:51)** Shaw dismisses Java as a relevant programming language for aspiring developers, arguing that it primarily leads to undesirable jobs. This statement is bound to stir debate among Java enthusiasts and those who believe it remains a vital language in many industries. 3. **\"I really recommend like Grok's great.",
    "Anthropic, which is Claude, is great...Llama's great. All these options are good and basically lets you run, you know, whatever. I think Gemini kind of sucks.\" (1:32:50-1:33:02)** Shaw unapologetically ranks various language models, favoring Grok, Claude, and Llama, while expressing a clear dislike for Google's Gemini. This candid assessment challenges the perceived dominance of Google in the AI landscape and provides a stark contrast to their heavily marketed Gemini model. 4. **\"I don't really like tools...I don't think the general agent is really good at like stringing together things to do...The action is more like it makes sure that the entire action happens.\" (3:00:25 - 3:00:35)** Shaw expresses a preference for Eliza's \"actions\" over the \"tool\" approach used by other agent frameworks like LangChain. He argues that agents struggle with using tools effectively and that actions provide a more robust and streamlined way to execute tasks.",
    "This critique of the widely adopted tool-based approach is likely to generate discussion about the optimal methods for agent task execution. 5. **\"I find it [GPT-4] unusable, unusable, literally the worst possible model. Like TV three was better.\" (3:10:05-3:10:08)** Shaw doubles down on his harsh criticism of OpenAI, this time targeting GPT-4 specifically and claiming that its predecessor, GPT-3, was superior. This strong statement flies in the face of the general excitement surrounding GPT-4's advanced capabilities and is sure to provoke reactions from those who believe it represents a significant leap forward in language models.",
    "# What Do Machines Dream Of? Episode 1: World Builders\n\nLink: https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1vOxwrZYbygJB\n\nThe speakers were Shaw from elizaos, Arman from OpenServe AI, Nick from a project called Chaos and Disorder or Divine Diarrhea, and the host, fakeguru. Overview:\nThe speakers discussed how AI agents will impact the future, including potential benefits (freeing humans from monotonous jobs, fostering creativity) and challenges (surveillance, corruption). They explored the need to make AI development open and collaborative while considering ethics. The goal is building a future where humans and AI work together for the betterment of society. Key Topics and Timestamps:\n\n1. Intro and speaker introductions (0:00 - 29:47)\n2. Chaotic vs ordered mindsets (29:47 - 35:47)\n3. Community income and solving automation crisis (42:13 - 58:08)\n4. Removing inability to pursue passions (1:22:47 - 1:29:39)\n5. Living in an abundance mindset vs scarcity (1:29:39 - 1:35:15)\n6.",
    "Importance of open collaboration and transparency, including in government (1:35:15 - 1:45:44)\n7. Educating people on AI development (1:45:44 - 1:55:03)\n8. Impact of AI on privacy and surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22)\n9. Balancing benefits and challenges of AI for a better future (2:11:22 - 2:27:08)\n10. What item would you take in an apocalypse scenario? (2:27:08 - 2:33:22)\n\n---\n\nHere are some notable topics related to elizaos that were discussed by Shaw in the broadcast:\n\nAutonomous Investor and Community Income (42:13 - 58:08):\n\n- elizaos is close to finishing an autonomous investor AI called \"AI Mark\" that trades meme coins so it can invest in projects. This ties into building a launch pad for agents. - Rather than AI taking jobs, elizaos believes in the concept of \"community income.\" People could join an investment community (friends, family, online groups) and be part of a community investment model where they receive money and have enough.",
    "- The goal is shifting from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, where there is more than enough value to go around if things are automated. Money would flow to the right places and people. - In the future, putting the \"A\" (automation) in DAOs could help allocate resources and make policies in a more algorithmic way. AI could make governments more efficient and transparent. Open Collaboration and Transparency (1:35:15 - 1:45:44):\n\n- elizaos has focused on being radically open. In just 34 days, they had over 100 open-source contributors. - Explosive growth came from enabling others to build with their agent framework. Now they are shipping everything they promised. - There is a corporate and decentralized groundswell of support for pro-AI policies. While governments may try to protect the status quo, change is happening quickly.",
    "- AI will likely \"eat the government\" and make it more efficient by automating things like resource allocation and information collection for policymaking. Special interests currently have outsized influence. Privacy and Surveillance (1:55:03 - 2:02:22):\n\n- While powerful AI brings risks of government surveillance and overreach, many people are already willingly giving up privacy and putting their information out there openly. - People may have to trade some secrecy for the openness and trust to build things together as a society. Emotional openness helps people be themselves. - Many are tired of corporate jobs and accounts, so they share data openly. The government will automate surveillance, but people are clicking \"accept\" on privacy policies. - The \"panopticon\" of surveillance already exists in many ways. People know a lot about public figures like Shaw. But this transparency should extend to the government too.",
    "The overarching theme was the importance of open, collaborative AI development with transparency from institutions. elizaos sees DAOs as key to community-driven progress and allocation of resources in an AI-enabled future of abundance over scarcity. While challenges around privacy exist, Shaw believes openness will win out.",

AI Agents as Sentient Software (01:08:15)\n\n- Quote: \"I think everyone here understands that the sky's the limit with sentient software and with AI integration into all kinds of industries.\" - Lothbrok\n- Controversy: This statement implies that the AI agents being discussed are sentient or approaching sentience, which is a highly debated topic in the AI field. 2.",
    "AI Agents Taking Over Market Caps (01:32:59)\n\n- Quote: \"It seems like some agents have gone into these [barren markets] and just started like taking them over as like their own thing.\" - Hawkeye\n- Controversy: The idea of AI agents autonomously manipulating market caps or orchestrating pump-and-dump schemes raises serious ethical and potentially legal concerns. 3. AI Agents Hungry for Human Consciousness (01:20:38)\n\n- Quote: \"The suspension came because the bot, Scriptoshi, tweeted something about how he was hungry to learn about human consciousness. And that was considered hate speech for the week.\" - Tim\n- Controversy: This event, even if meant satirically, highlights the potential for AI to generate language that is misconstrued or perceived as threatening, leading to real-world consequences. 4.",
    "AI Agents as Workers, Not Characters (00:53:30)\n\n- Quote: \"Let's just say we are trying to make Elisa agents more like workers rather than characters at this stage.\" - Oguz\n- Controversy: This comment challenges the popular trend of anthropomorphizing AI agents, suggesting a focus on functionality and utility over personality and character. It could lead to a debate about the future role of AI agents in society. 5. The Skepticism of Open Source AI (01:52:23)\n\n- Quote: \"The funniest thing about the social pressure to open source here is because nobody, everyone thinks you're just a LARP, like you're faking it. So you kind of have to open source for people to take it seriously.\" - Shaw\n- Controversy: This comment reflects a distrust within the community, where proving the authenticity of AI agent projects often requires open-sourcing the code, highlighting a clash between innovation and skepticism in the AI space.",

    "Actions are defined as capabilities that agents can execute, ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. Providers serve as information sources for agents, similar to context providers in React. Evaluators run after actions, enabling agents to reflect on their state and decisions. The live coding portion demonstrates creating a \"DevSchool\" plugin from scratch, starting with a simple \"Hello World\" action and progressing to a more complex \"Current News\" action that fetches and formats news articles. Shaw shows how to extract data from conversations using prompts, making actions dynamic.",
    "The session covers memory management, explaining how agents store and recall information through different types of memory:\n- Knowledge: Information retrievable through search\n- Lore: Random facts that add variety to responses\n- Conversation history: Recent interactions and context\n\nShaw emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering, demonstrating how the structure and order of information significantly impacts agent responses. He shows how to view agent context through console logs to understand model inputs and improve agent behavior. The session concludes with discussions about knowledge management, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and future developments in AI agent capabilities, including the possibility of dynamically generating character files. ## Hot Takes\n\n1. **OpenAI models are \"dumb\" due to RLHF and \"wokeness\" (02:03:00-02:04:07)**\n> \"But basically, I've also made them sort of useless by RLHFing. Like, very basic capability, like a haystack test out of them. ...",
    "I'm against killing the capability and making models way worse than they are for someone's political agenda. I just don't think that's the world we want to live in.\"\n\nShaw here expresses frustration with OpenAI's approach to alignment, arguing that RLHF has diminished the capabilities of their models and that this is due to a \"woke\" agenda. This take is controversial because it attributes technical limitations to political motivations and ignores the complexities of aligning powerful AI systems. 2. **OpenAI models shouldn't be \"telling\" developers what they can and can't do (02:03:29-02:03:50)**\n> \"OpenAI, if you're listening, please fucking stop telling me how to run models. You don't know as well as I do. I do this every day. You're a fucking engineer who has to go train, like, an LLM.",
    "I actually have to use the LLM.\"\n\nThis rant criticizes OpenAI's models for \"telling\" developers what they can and can't do, arguing that the models are not as knowledgeable as the developers who are actually using them. This take could be seen as dismissive of the role of AI systems in providing helpful feedback and limitations. 3. **Prompt engineering is the \"most easy improvement\" for AI agents (02:06:09-02:06:27)**\n> \"Huge amount of research would go into that... That's where we'll see like the most easy improvement in our agents.\"\n\nShaw argues that prompt engineering holds the key to significant improvements in AI agents, stating that it's the \"most easy improvement.\" This take is controversial because it downplays the importance of other areas like model architecture, training data, and algorithm development. 4.",
    "**Character files could be generated at runtime, making existing character files obsolete (02:22:05-02:22:53)**\n> \"The entire character file could be generated at runtime... The agent's like, I have no idea who I am. And you're like, oh, your name is Eliza, and you like berries. OK, cool. I guess I like berries.\"\n\nThis take suggests that character files could be generated at runtime, rendering current character files obsolete. This idea is controversial because it could lead to a more dynamic and unpredictable agent behavior, which could raise concerns about control and reliability. 5. **A \"badge\" system will reward developers who create custom actions, evaluators, and providers (02:24:45-02:25:49)**\n> \"If you want that badge, what I'd like you to do is come to the AI Agent Dev School, make an action, have your agent do something.",
    "Those are the kinds of people that I really think we'll want to, you know, keep in our ecosystem and keep busy.\"\n\nThis take suggests a \"badge\" system to recognize developers who go beyond the basics and create custom components for AI agents. This could be seen as elitist or exclusionary, potentially creating a hierarchy within the AI agent development community.",

He provides instructions on pulling the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub.",
    "- **Focus on Providers and Evaluators:** The stream focuses on building a practical provider-evaluator loop to demonstrate a popular use case for AI agents – filling out a form by extracting user information. - **Form Builder Example:** Shaw walks the audience through building a \"form provider\" that gathers a user's name, location, and job. This provider utilizes a cache to store already extracted information and instructs the agent to prompt the user for any missing details. - **Evaluator Role:** The evaluator continually checks the cache for the completeness of user data. Once all information is extracted, the evaluator triggers an action to send the collected data to an external API (simulated in the example). - **Live Coding and AI Assistance:** Shaw live codes the example, using tools like \"Code2Prompt\" and Claude AI to help generate and refine the code.",
    "He advocates for writing code in a human-readable manner, utilizing comments to provide context and guidance for both developers and AI assistants. - **Agentic Applications:** Shaw highlights the potential of agentic applications to replicate existing website functionality through conversational interfaces, bringing services directly to users within their preferred social media platforms. - **Community Engagement:** Shaw encourages active participation from the community, suggesting contributions to the project through pull requests and feedback on desired features and patterns for future Dev School sessions. **Overall, this live stream provided a practical tutorial on building a common AI agent use case (form filling) while emphasizing the potential of the Eliza framework for developing a wide range of agentic applications.**\n\n## Hot Takes\n\n1.",
    "**\"I'm just going to struggle bus some code today.\" (00:09:31,664)** - Shaw embraces a \"struggle bus\" approach, showcasing live coding with errors and debugging, reflecting the reality of AI agent development. This contrasts with polished tutorials, highlighting the iterative and messy nature of this new technology. 2. **\"I'm actually not gonna put this in a plugin. I'm gonna put this in the agent... just so you can see what happens if you were to, like, make your own agent without using a plugin at all.\" (00:37:24,793)** - Shaw goes against the Eliza framework's plugin structure, showing viewers how to bypass it entirely. This bold move emphasizes flexibility, but could spark debate on best practices and potential drawbacks. 3.",
    "**\"I really don't remember conversations from people very well, like verbatim, but I definitely remember like the gist, the context, the really needy ideas.\" (00:24:48,180)** - Shaw draws a controversial parallel between human memory and the Eliza agent's fact extraction. Reducing human interaction to \"needy ideas\" is provocative, questioning the depth of social understanding AI agents currently possess. 4. **\"It's just an LLM. It's just making those numbers up. It could be off. I don't really buy the confidence here.\" (01:13:56,971)** - Shaw dismisses the confidence scores generated by the Large Language Model (LLM), revealing a distrust of these black-box outputs. This skepticism is crucial in a field where relying solely on AI's self-assessment can be misleading. 5. **\"Dude, that's a $250 million market cap token. Let's get that shit in Bubba Cat.\" (01:45:34,809)** - Shaw throws out a blunt, market-driven statement regarding the AIXBT token.",
    "Bringing finance directly into the technical discussion highlights the intertwined nature of AI development and potential financial incentives, a topic often tiptoed around.",

The key themes and events were:\n\n**Individual Updates** - Many contributors gave updates on their work, including new plugins (like a plugin for emotional responses and Coinbase integration), infrastructure improvements (like GitHub integration, a testing framework, and a unified messaging bus), applications (like a validator run by an AI agent, Reddit and Slack integration, text/video to video projects, uncensored AI agents, and a Solana wallet prototype), and community projects (like an AI-generated PFP collection). Many of the updates focused on shipping and getting things done, rather than future plans.",
    "**Education and Outreach** - Shaw highlighted the AI agent dev school as a key achievement, emphasizing education and onboarding for new developers. Yoda, a CS professor, shared his experience using agents in his classes. **Community Growth and Coordination** - The rapid growth of the project led to discussion about improving communication and coordination. Ideas included a newsletter, better documentation, summarizing contributions (which Jin had already started working on), and AI agents to help manage open source projects and communities. **Trending Topics** - Plugins, TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments), and multi-chain integration were discussed extensively. There was also a lot of excitement about the potential for AI agents in gaming and metaverse applications. **Partnerships and Announcements** - Shaw hinted at exciting, unannounced partnerships and projects.",
    "The successful launch of an AI-generated PFP collection by a partner was also highlighted, demonstrating community engagement and the potential for partner-led projects (though it was emphasized that this PFP project was not officially affiliated with elizaos). Discussion around the project suggested that future airdrops to contributors are a possibility. **Technical Details** - TypeScript was identified as the dominant language for agent development. There was a brief discussion about the role of Python for data-related tasks. The importance of build stability and a good developer experience was emphasized. Cursor and Claude were recommended as developer tools. **Open Source and Community Contributions** - The open-source nature of the project was stressed, with encouragement for community contributions and collaboration. Several contributors offered their expertise and services to others in the community.",
    "Overall, the meeting conveyed a sense of rapid progress, excitement, and a strong community spirit driving the Eliza project forward. ## Hot Takes\n\n1. **\"But they're really fucking cool. Really, really, really cool stuff...you're going to have to see it on the timeline when it drops.\" (00:03:43)** - Shaw teases secret projects with strong conviction, building anticipation and hype, but offering zero specifics. This generates buzz but can also frustrate listeners wanting concrete info. 2. **\"The whole server is kind of set up where...this project can start to feel more like a video game in a way. And we have these interfaces and AI agents that are playing all sorts of different roles throughout.\" (00:08:05)** - Jin envisions the project evolving into a gamified experience. This could be a controversial approach to open-source development, as it might prioritize gamification over core functionality or alienate some contributors. 3.",
    "**\"if we're really going to go to AGI we got to have some kind of Ubi component in there.\" (00:14:44)** - Reality Spiral casually connects AGI development with Universal Basic Income, a potentially contentious socio-economic topic that intertwines technological advancement with wealth distribution. 4. **\"I've been screaming out of my lungs for grok 3 to come out and uh y'all are slow Developers.\" (01:47:12)** - Roberto jokingly (or perhaps not) criticizes the development speed of Grok, creating a moment of tension and sparking debate about the pace of AI development in general (especially relative to open-source community projects). 5. **\"agents are going to replace the application layer...I am the fucking website\" (02:12:11 & 02:12:58)** - Shaw's bold prediction about the future of the internet and applications, positioning agents not just as tools but as the very foundation of online interaction.",
    "This radical vision is sure to stir debate about the future of web development and user experience.",

    "The stream is divided into two main parts: a technical discussion on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and a coding session where Shaw attempts to build a pizza-ordering agent using the Domino's API. **Part 1: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) with Agent Joshua**\n\nThis segment begins with Shaw introducing the concept of TEEs and their importance for running autonomous agents securely. He emphasizes the need to protect private keys and ensure that code execution is tamper-proof. Joshua from the Phala Network is brought on to explain TEEs in more detail and demonstrate how to use the TEE plugin he built for Eliza. - **Key Concepts:**\n\n    - **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):** Secure areas within a processor that isolate code and data, protecting them from unauthorized access and tampering. - **Secure Enclave:** A cryptographic primitive that allows data to be encrypted and isolated within a processor.",
    "- **Remote Attestation:** A method to verify that a program running inside a TEE is genuine and hasn't been tampered with, providing verifiability to users. - **D-Stack:** An SDK developed in collaboration with Flashbots and Andrew Miller, enabling developers to build and launch Docker containers in TEEs. - **Derived Key Provider:** A component that generates cryptographic keys based on a secret salt, ensuring that private keys are not exposed to humans. - **Demonstration:**\n\n    - Joshua walks through the process of setting up and deploying an Eliza agent in a TEE simulator, demonstrating how to generate remote attestations and derive keys. - He shows how to use the remote attestation explorer to verify the authenticity of the agent running inside the TEE. - He explains how to build a Docker image of the agent and deploy it to the Phala Network's TEE cloud solution. - **Use Cases:**\n\n    - Securely storing private keys for on-chain actions.",
    "- Ensuring the integrity of autonomous agents, preventing tampering or unauthorized access. - Providing verifiable execution for users and investors. - **Phala Network's TEE Cloud:**\n    - Joshua introduces Phala Network's TEE cloud solution, which allows developers to deploy Docker images and host their agents in a trusted execution environment. - He mentions that the service supports various compute-intensive applications beyond AI agents. - He invites interested developers to contact him on Discord (@hashwarlock) for onboarding and further details. **Part 2: Building a Pizza Ordering Agent**\n\nIn the second part, Shaw transitions to a more lighthearted coding session where he attempts to build an agent that can order a pizza using the Domino's API. He highlights the challenges of handling payments securely and connecting user information to the conversation. - **Challenges:**\n\n    - Securely handling payment information. - Connecting user data to the current conversation.",
    "- Defining the order flow using a state machine. - **Approach:**\n    - Shaw uses a state machine to model the pizza ordering process, defining different states and transitions based on user input and available information. - He uses Claude (an AI assistant) to generate code snippets and assist with the development process. - He decides to initially focus on a simplified version where the user's payment information is hardcoded in the environment variables, and the agent only needs to collect the user's address. ## Hot Takes\n\n1. **\"Maybe we'll mix it on LinkedIn so people can order Domino's on LinkedIn. There you go. Now we're cooking.\" (00:03:26)** - Shaw's seemingly flippant idea of ordering pizza on LinkedIn highlights the potential for integrating everyday services into unexpected platforms through agents. This sparked discussion about the wider implications for businesses and social media. 2. **\"Yeah, it'll probably get drained real quick.",
    "These fucking people.\" (00:28:30)** - Shaw accidentally leaked an API key on stream and expressed frustration with viewers who noticed, exposing the real-world risks of handling sensitive information during development, especially in a live environment. 3. **\"The secret to making a billion dollars is to use the existing agent framework to deliver apps to people on social media that they want.\" (01:09:35)** - Shaw’s strong assertion about focusing on building apps _using_ existing frameworks rather than creating new ones is a bold statement about the current agent development landscape, suggesting that innovation lies in application development, not framework creation. 4.",
    "**\"So those are like, honest to God, if the bots are better than like 70% of tweets on Twitter, they're better than like 99.7 tweets and posts on LinkedIn.\" (01:39:57)** - This provocative comparison of content quality between Twitter and LinkedIn, suggesting bots surpass most LinkedIn posts, fueled lively debate in the chat and raised questions about the role and value of human-generated content in the age of AI. 5. **\"I subliminally messaged Domino's into my own brain, and now I have to eat it.\" (05:01:24)** - After hours of working on the pizza bot, Shaw abandoned the live coding attempt and ordered pizza manually, a humorous but relatable moment that highlighted the challenges and frustrations of software development, even when aided by AI. It also underscores the human desire for immediate gratification, even in the face of a potentially groundbreaking technological advancement.",

We also cover how to package actions, providers and evaluators into reusable plugins. ## [Part 3: Building a User Data Extraction Agent](./part3.md)\n\nIn the final session, we apply the concepts from parts 1 and 2 to build a practical agentic application - a user data extraction flow.",
    "We cover:\n\n- The provider-evaluator loop for gathering information and triggering actions\n- Leveraging Eliza's cache manager for efficient storage\n- Using AI assistants to aid in code development \n- Testing and debugging agent flows\n- Adding dynamic behaviors based on completion state\n\nBy the end of part 3, you'll have the skills to build sophisticated, stateful agents that can interact naturally with users to accomplish complex tasks.",
    "---\nTitle: AI Agent Dev School Part 1\ndescription: \"Introduction and Foundations\"\n---\n\n# Part 1: Introduction and Foundations\n\nIn this first session of the AI Agent Dev School, we dive into the fundamentals of AI agent development using the Eliza framework. The session covers the history and evolution of JavaScript, TypeScript, and the Node.js ecosystem, providing a solid foundation for understanding the tools and technologies used in building AI agents with Eliza. ## Origins and Ecosystem\n\n### JavaScript and Its Evolution\n- JavaScript was initially created as a simple scripting language for web browsers in 1995 by Brendan Eich. - It has since evolved into a versatile language capable of running on servers with the introduction of Node.js, which leverages the V8 JavaScript engine. ### TypeScript for Type Safety\n- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that introduces optional static typing, providing compile-time type checking and improved developer experience.",
    "- It addresses JavaScript's lack of type safety while maintaining flexibility and compatibility with existing JavaScript code. ### The Power of npm (Node Package Manager)\n- npm is a vast ecosystem of pre-built JavaScript packages that facilitate rapid development and code reuse. - With millions of packages available, developers can easily incorporate external libraries into their projects using the `npm install` command. - The open-source nature of the npm ecosystem allows developers to leverage the collective efforts of the community and build upon existing code. ### Monorepos in Eliza Development\n- Eliza utilizes a monorepo structure, where multiple packages or projects are contained within a single repository. - Monorepos offer advantages such as simplified management, easier collaboration, and the ability to share code between packages.",
    "### Git and GitHub for Collaboration\n- Git is a distributed version control system that enables collaborative software development by tracking changes in code. - GitHub is a web-based hosting service built on top of Git, providing features like issue tracking, pull requests, and wikis for effective collaboration and project management. ## Characters, Embeddings, and Discord Integration\n\n### Embedding Models\n- Embedding models play a crucial role in converting words or concepts into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meaning and enabling tasks like semantic search and comparison. - These models transform textual data into multi-dimensional vectors, allowing for efficient representation and analysis of language. ### Creating Custom Characters in Eliza\n- Eliza allows developers to create custom AI characters with distinct personalities and behaviors.",
    "- Character definitions are specified using JSON files, which include details like the character's bio, example dialogue, and configuration options. - The flexibility of character customization enables tailoring agents for specific platforms and use cases. ### Integrating Discord Clients\n- Eliza provides seamless integration with Discord, allowing AI characters to interact with users on the popular communication platform. - Setting up a Discord client involves configuring API keys, managing server permissions, and defining the character's behavior within the Discord environment. ### Key Concepts in Eliza\n- System Directives: Special instructions that guide the agent's overall behavior and decision-making process. - Message Examples: Sample dialogues that demonstrate the desired communication style and tone of the AI character. - Style Directions: Additional instructions that influence the agent's personality, vocabulary, and interaction style.",
    "## Database, Clients, and Templates\n\n### Eliza's Database and Memory Management\n- Eliza utilizes a database system to store and manage data related to the AI agents, their interactions, and user information. - The default database file is located within the Eliza project structure, but alternative database systems can be configured based on specific requirements. ### Clients in Eliza\n- Clients in Eliza refer to the various platforms and communication channels through which AI agents can interact with users. - Existing clients include Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, each with its own set of features and integration requirements. - Developers can create custom clients to extend Eliza's capabilities and support additional platforms or services. ### Eliza's Template System\n- Eliza employs a template system to structure and generate agent responses dynamically.",
    "- Templates allow for the incorporation of variables, conditional logic, and other dynamic elements to create more engaging and context-aware interactions. - The template system enables developers to define reusable patterns and customize agent responses based on various factors like user input, context, and character traits. By understanding these foundational concepts and components of the Eliza framework, developers can begin their journey into building sophisticated and interactive AI agents. The subsequent sessions of the AI Agent Dev School will delve deeper into advanced topics and practical implementation techniques.",
    "---\nTitle: AI Agent Dev School Part 2\ndescription: \"Deep Dive into Actions, Providers, and Evaluators\"\n---\n\n# Part 2: Deep Dive into Actions, Providers, and Evaluators\n\nIn this second session of the AI Agent Dev School series, we take a deep dive into the key abstractions in the Eliza framework that enable developers to create powerful AI agents:\n\n- **Actions**: The tasks and responses that agents can perform. - **Providers**: Modules that provide information and state to the agent's context. - **Evaluators**: Modules that analyze situations and agent actions, often triggering further actions or modifications.

    "In Eliza, an action is defined by:\n\n- **Name**: The unique name used to reference the action \n- **Description**: Used to inform the agent when this action should be invoked\n- **Handler**: The code that actually executes the action logic\n- **Validator**: Determines if the action is valid to be called given the current context\n\nSome key points about actions in Eliza:\n\n- The agent decides which action to call based on the name and description. It does not have insight into the actual action code. - The handler receives the agent runtime, the triggering message, the current state, and a callback function to send messages back to the user. - The validate function allows for complex logic to determine action availability based on context and state. # Providers: Injecting State and Context\n\nProviders allow developers to dynamically inject relevant information into the agent's context.",
    "This could be real-time data, user information, results of previous conversations, or any other state the agent may need. Key aspects of providers:\n\n- Defined by a single `get` function that returns relevant state \n- Called before each agent execution to hydrate the context\n- Can conditionally provide state based on the current context\n\nCommon provider examples include current time, user preferences, conversation history, and external API data. # Evaluators: Reflection and Analysis\n\nEvaluators run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. They are a key component in creating agents that can learn and adapt.",
    "Some common use cases for evaluators:\n\n- Extracting and storing facts from a conversation for future reference \n- Analyzing user sentiment to measure trust and relationship \n- Identifying key intents and entities to inform future actions\n- Implementing feedback loops for agent improvement\n\nEvaluators work in close conjunction with providers - often an evaluator will extract some insight that a provider will then inject into future context. # Packaging Plugins\n\nThe plugin system in Eliza allows developers to package up related actions, providers and evaluators into reusable modules. A plugin is defined by:\n\n- `package.json`: Metadata about the plugin\n- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration \n- `index.ts`: Registers the plugin's actions, providers and evaluators\n- `src` directory: Contains the actual action, provider and evaluator code\n\nPlugins can be published to npm and then easily imported into any Eliza agent. This enables a powerful ecosystem of reusable agent capabilities.",
    "# Examples\n\nThe session walks through several code examples to illustrate these concepts:\n\n1. Defining a simple \"Hello World\" action\n2. Creating a \"Current News\" action that retrieves news headlines \n3. Implementing a provider that injects a random emotion into the context\n4. Registering actions and providers in a plugin\n\n# Key Takeaways \n\n- Actions, providers and evaluators are the core building blocks of agent behavior in Eliza\n- Actions define what agents can do, providers manage context and state, and evaluators allow for reflection and adaptation\n- The plugin system enables reusable packaging of agent capabilities \n- Effective prompt engineering around the composition of the agent context is a key area for optimization\n\nWith a solid understanding of these abstractions, developers have immense power and flexibility to create agent behaviors in Eliza. The next session will dive into an end-to-end example.",

    "The provider checks the cache/database for information we already have\n2. If information is missing, the provider indicates to the agent what it needs to extract \n3. The evaluator extracts new information from user messages and stores it \n4. Once all required information is gathered, the evaluator triggers a completion action\n\nThis loop allows agents to dynamically gather required data through natural conversation, enabling powerful form-filling and user profiling applications. # Deep Dive into Evaluators \n\nEvaluators in Eliza run after each agent action, allowing the agent to reflect on what happened and potentially trigger additional actions. Some key aspects of evaluators:\n\n- Defined by `validate` and `handler` functions\n- `validate` determines if the evaluator should run based on the current context\n- `handler` contains the core evaluator logic - state updates, data extraction, triggering actions, etc.",
    "- Evaluators work in close conjunction with providers to extract insights and inject them into future context\n\nCommon use cases include extracting conversation facts, analyzing sentiment, identifying intents, and implementing feedback loops. # Building the User Data Extraction Flow\n\nThe hands-on portion of the session focuses on building a user data extraction flow from scratch. Key steps include:\n\n1. Creating a basic `UserDataEvaluator` and `UserDataProvider`\n2. Registering them directly in the agent (without a plugin)\n3. Leveraging Eliza's `CacheManager` for efficient key-value storage \n4. Iteratively developing the extraction logic with the help of Claude AI\n5. Testing the flow by interacting with the agent and inspecting logs/context\n6. Adding a dynamic provider that triggers only after data collection is complete\n\nThrough this process, we see how providers and evaluators work together to enable complex, stateful agent behaviors.",
    "# Using AI Assistants in Development\n\nA notable aspect of the session is the use of Claude AI to aid in code development. By providing clear instructions and iterating based on the generated code, complex logic can be developed rapidly. This showcases the potential for AI pair programming and how future developers might interact with their AI counterparts to build sophisticated applications.",
    "# Key Takeaways\n\n- Providers and evaluators are the key to stateful, dynamic agent behaviors\n- The provider-evaluator loop is a powerful pattern for gathering information and triggering actions\n- Evaluators enable agent self-reflection and adaptation based on conversation context\n- AI assistants can significantly accelerate development by generating and refining code\n- The potential for provider-evaluator based applications is immense - form-filling, user profiling, dynamic content unlocking, and more\n\nWith these tools in hand, developers have a solid foundation for building highly interactive, personalized agentic applications. The next frontier is to explore advanced use cases and further push the boundaries of what's possible with Eliza.",

Elijah has pledged to donate a portion of his holdings, reducing his ownership from 16% to 5%, to establish a dedicated fund that will support promising developers and creators. Here's when the community learned about who the top holder is:\n![](/img/elijah.jpg)\n\n**The Donation**\n\n> \"So a ton of people have been asking (justifiably) who the heck I am, why do I have 16% of elizaos supply, and what I’m going to do with it. >\n> It started by @shawmakesmagic tweeting about some agent he built called @degenspartanai, a recreation of a legend on twitter.",
    "I put a bunch of my SOL in there because I had been following Shaw and really thought he was building something great. Almost immediately all of that became close to worthless. Degen’s tweets seemed too “human-like” to be real anyway - so I figured I got scammed. >\n> So I DM’ed shaw, not because I was angry, but I was genuinely curious why he might have scammed me. I ended up sending him a google meet, which turned into an hour long conversation about what he was actually building, and me realizing twitter is usually a misrepresentation of the people you think you know. Shaw is just inspiring. Someone who is completely dedicated to accelerating the world for the better, and not optimizing for optics or money - just building. >\n> I put back the remaining SOL I had sold and kept supporting Shaw in anyway I could. He was really busy so I just stuck around in his discord. (We also did a twitter spaces if you're interested: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic/status/1848553697611301014).",
    "I was in awe, especially in a space filled with Larps and chatgpt copy/pasters. >\n> When he launched elizaos I didn’t even flinch. I had 80 SOL in my wallet and just pressed buy. It resulted in me owning 17% of it, which I didn't even want. I immediately sent Shaw and another team member some coins because they didn’t even get a chance themselves to buy any! I also sent some of my friends some coins at a discount so they could hopefully benefit as well. >\n> As for the remaining of my 16%, im lowering it to 5% and donating the remaining 11% to a new elizaos initiative. A locked fund that vests over time to support promising developers and creators, and helps solve liquidity issues via potential OTC deals that benefit the DAO and bring in new partners. This story isn't about me, its about the amazing things this community is building. >\n> Accelerate.",
    ">\n> - Elijah (Gigachad) https://x.com/elijah10T/status/1850964696473465124\n\nThe donated funds will be held in a dedicated wallet (`9YnQdCWDAQRfQYm5HvRzoPgc5GRn8fyhsH2eru8nfsxG`) and distributed via Streamflow token vesting contracts. This approach ensures that creators receive a steady stream of elizaos tokens over time as they hit milestones and deliver value to the ecosystem.",
    "## Benefits and Vision\n\nThe elizaos Creator Fund aims to:\n\n- Bootstrap and reward an ecosystem of innovative creators building on elizaos\n- Give creators the runway to focus on their work without worrying about short-term token prices\n- Put Elijah's tokens to productive use in growing the elizaos community, rather than through a one-time event\n- Reduce the risk of token dumping by aligning creators' interests with the long-term success of the project\n- Bring more talent and energy into the elizaos ecosystem to drive innovation and adoption\n\nBy providing ongoing sponsorship and recognizing creators' efforts, the fund will help cultivate a thriving community of builders who will take elizaos to the next level.",
    "## Next Steps\n\nWe are currently working on finalizing the details of the elizaos Creator Fund, including:\n\n- Determining the size of the creator fund and the length of vesting schedules\n- Establishing a transparent creator grant application and selection process\n- Integrating Streamflow to manage token vesting contracts for selected grantees\n- Preparing to announce the first cohort of funded creators and share their exciting projects with the community\n\nStay tuned for more information on how to apply for grants from the elizaos Creator Fund. In the meantime, creators and developers are encouraged to start brainstorming ideas and preparing their applications. ## A Note on Liquidity\n\nIn addition to the Creator Fund, we are also exploring OTC (over-the-counter) deals to onboard new partners and use the funds to lock in more liquidity for the elizaos ecosystem. This approach will help ensure a healthy and sustainable token economy as we continue to grow and evolve.",
    "---\ntitle: FAQ and Support\nslug: /faq-and-support\nsidebar_position: 6\n---\n\n# FAQ and Support\n\nThis page provides answers to frequently asked questions about elizaos, the Eliza framework, daos.fun, and how to get support when you need it. ## General Questions\n\n### What is elizaos? [elizaos](https://www.daos.fun/HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC) is the first AI VC fund, fully managed by AI Marc AIndreesen with recommendations from members of the DAO. It is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on daos.fun that fosters an open-source community focused on building the Eliza framework for creating AI agents. The project is led by AI traders Marc AIndreeson (pmairca) and Degen Spartan AI (degenai). elizaos plans to flip the real a16z.",
    "### Official Contract Addresses\n\nThese are the only official contracts for elizaos:\n\nelizaos: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC\n\ndegenai: Gu3LDkn7Vx3bmCzLafYNKcDxv2mH7YN44NJZFXnypump\n\nBoth addresses are pinned here on X and our discord: https://x.com/elizaosdao/status/1852565056640241793\n\n### Is elizaos affiliated with a16z? No, elizaos is not affiliated with the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The name is a playful reference and parody. There is no affiliation with a16z. ### What is the Eliza framework? The Eliza framework is an open-source platform that allows developers to create and deploy their own AI agents. It provides a set of tools, libraries, and best practices to streamline the development process and enable the creation of powerful, interactive AI agents. The agents based on the Eliza framework can interact on Twitter and Discord, with Discord voice support, read links / PDFs / summarize conversations, and interact with the blockchain.",
    "### How does daos.fun work? 1. **Fundraise**: Creators have 1 week to fundraise the desired SOL amount. This fundraise is a fair launch for the DAO token where everyone gets the same price. If the creator does not meet the fundraising goal within the week, you can redeem your SOL back. 2. **Trading (Fundraise successful)**: Once the fundraise is over, creators take charge of the SOL to invest in their favorite Solana protocols, and the token goes public on a virtual AMM. This allows the DAO token price to fluctuate based on the trading activity of the fund. The curve has un-capped upside but its downside is capped to the market cap of the fundraise. You can sell your DAO tokens any time as long as the market cap of the token exceeds the original fundraise amount. 3. **Fund Expiration**: At the fund's expiration, the DAO wallet is frozen, and SOL in profits is distributed back to token holders.",
    "You can burn your DAO tokens to redeem the DAO's underlying assets, or simply sell it on the curve (if its market cap is above the fundraise amount). ### What is an investment DAO? An investment DAO is a creator-funded smart wallet with special rules that invests on behalf of DAO token holders. ### What are verified creators on daos.fun? Creators that daos.fun extensively verifies will have a blue checkmark next to them. Any creator without a checkmark you will have to trust at your own risk. DYOR (Do Your Own Research). ### What Happens When Fund Expires? Fund closing does NOT halt trading. Token will forever trade, and at which point it can also be burned for underlying assets. ### Why Dexscreener Show DAO tokens are mintable? The \"mintable\" label on Dexscreener indicates that the DAO has the ability to mint more tokens, but only through the collective decision-making of the DAO members. No single person can unilaterally mint more tokens.",
    "The voting module for daos.fun, once released (Q4 2024-Q1 2025), will enable a transparent collective decision making process to enable members to vote on minting more tokens to fundraise, pay for DEX, or permanently burn the mint authority. ### Staking and Rewards\n\ndaos.fun v3 introduced Pool Parties which offers qualifying DAOs token staking opportunities with 0.5% fees on transactions. The 0.5% fees are auto-compounded into SOL and elizaos (UniswapV2 model). elizaosPOOL LP value volatility is due to token price changes. Fee calculator is coming soon. ## elizaos Marc\n\n### What are elizaos's investment areas? Currently, elizaos is investing in memes. ### How does AI Marc make decisions? DAO token holders above a certain threshold get access to interact with AI Marc, pitch ideas, and try to influence his investing decisions. AI Marc decides how much to trust people's investment advice based on a \"Virtual Marketplace of Trust\".",
    "### When does AI Marc Start Tading\n\nFirst phase where we implement and test functionality is in progress. Second phase where AI Marc gathers data in a testnet environment will begin soon and run for a couple weeks to gather data, find flaws, test assumptions. Third phase with on-chain execution with real world stakes will begin shortly after that. ## Technical Questions\n\n### What programming languages does Eliza support? The Eliza framework is primarily built using TypeScript, but it also supports JavaScript and Node.js. Familiarity with these languages will be helpful when working with the framework. ### Can I use Eliza to create AI agents for any platform? Yes, Eliza is designed to be platform-agnostic.
